Zygmunt Bauman,"O medo é uma das marcas do nosso tempo. Em Medo líquido, Bauman faz mais um estudo singular sobre a vida contemporânea e revela um inventário dos medos atuais. O ser humano vive hoje em meio a uma ansiedade constante. Temos medo de perder o emprego, medo da violência urbana, do terrorismo, medo de ficar sem o amor do parceiro, da exclusão. O resultado? Temos que nos atualizar sempre e acumular conhecimentos, circulamos dentro de shopping centers, dirigimos carros blindados, vivemos em condomínios fechados. O medo é uma das marcas do nosso tempo. Em Medo líquido, Bauman faz mais um estudo singular sobre a vida contemporânea e revela um inventário dos medos atuais. O sociólogo mapeia as origens comuns das ansiedades na modernidade líquida e examina mecanismos que possam deter a influência do medo sobre as nossas vidas. Segundo o autor, as certezas da modernidade sólida se foram, e, com isso, a utopia do controle sobre os mundos social, econômico e natural desmoronou.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Zygmunt Bauman\Medo liquido (3)\cover.jpg,9788537808542,2008-01-08T13:08:18+00:00,Editora Schwarcz - Companhia das Letras,,,1.0,"Social Science, Sociology, General, Anthropology, Cultural & Social",Medo líquido,3
Simon Conway Morris,"How did human beings acquire imaginations that can conjure up untrue possibilities? How did the Universe become self-aware? In The Runes of Evolution, Simon Conway Morris revitalizes the study of evolution from the perspective of convergence, providing us with compelling new evidence to support the mounting scientific view that the history of life is far more predictable than once thought.  A leading evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge, Conway Morris came into international prominence for his work on the Cambrian explosion (especially fossils of the Burgess Shale) and evolutionary convergence, which is the process whereby organisms not closely related (not monophyletic), independently evolve similar traits as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches.  In The Runes of Evolution, he illustrates how the ubiquity of convergence hints at an underlying framework whereby many outcomes, not least brains and intelligence, are virtually guaranteed on any Earth-like planet. Conway Morris also emphasizes how much of the complexity of advanced biological systems is inherent in microbial forms.  By casting a wider net, The Runes of Evolution explores many neglected evolutionary questions. Some are remarkably general. Why, for example, are convergences such as parasitism, carnivory, and nitrogen fixation in plants concentrated in particular taxonomic hot spots? Why do certain groups have a particular propensity to evolve toward particular states?  Some questions lead to unexpected evolutionary insights: If bees sleep (as they do), do they dream? Why is that insect copulating with an orchid? Why have sponges evolved a system of fiber optics? What do mantis shrimps and submarines have in common? If dinosaurs had not gone extinct what would have happened next? Will a saber-toothed cat ever re-evolve?  Cona Morris observes: “Even amongst the mammals, let alone the entire tree of life, humans represent one minute twig of a vast (and largely fossilized) arborescence. Every living species is a linear descendant of an immense string of now-vanished ancestors, but evolution itself is the very reverse of linear. Rather it is endlessly exploratory, probing the vast spaces of biological hyperspace. Indeed this book is a celebration of how our world is (and was) populated by a riot of forms, a coruscating tapestry of life.”  The Runes of Evolution is the most definitive synthesis of evolutionary convergence to be published to date.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Simon Conway Morris\The Runes of Evolution_ How the Univ (4)\cover.jpg,9781599474649,2015-06-22T14:28:42+01:00,Templeton Press,,,1.0,"Science, General, Life Sciences, Evolution, Philosophy & Social Aspects, Religion, Religion & Science",The Runes of Evolution: How the Universe Became Self-Aware,4
Zora Neale Hurston,"One of the most important works of twentieth-century American literature, Zora Neale Hurston's beloved 1937 classic, Their Eyes Were Watching God, is an enduring Southern love story sparkling with wit, beauty, and heartfelt wisdom. Told in the captivating voice of a woman who refuses to live in sorrow, bitterness, fear, or foolish romantic dreams, it is the story of fair-skinned, fiercely independent Janie Crawford, and her evolving selfhood through three marriages and a life marked by poverty, trials, and purpose.

Yuval Noah Harari,"""From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution--a #1 international bestseller--that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ""human."" One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas .Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Yann Martel,"SUMMARY: The son of a zookeeper, Pi Patel has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior and a fervent love of stories. When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days while lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again.

William Styron,"This award-winning novel of love, survival, and agonizing regret in post–WWII Brooklyn “belongs on that small shelf reserved for American masterpieces” (The Washington Post Book World).  Winner of the National Book Award and a modern classic, Sophie’s Choice centers on three characters: Stingo, a sexually frustrated aspiring novelist; Nathan, his charismatic but violent Jewish neighbor; and Sophie, an Auschwitz survivor who is Nathan’s lover.

William Shakespeare & Morgan D. Rosenberg,"'The Tempest', a short and juicy play, encapsulates many of the dramatic elements that delight admirers of the Shakespearean oeuvre: betrayal, good spirits, evil relations, loyal friends, dramatic plot twists, terrible weather and, of course, love.

Washington Irving,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Other Writings, by Washington Irving, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.   The first great American man of letters, Washington Irving became an international celebrity almost overnight upon publication of The Sketch Book in 1820, which included the short stories “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle.” These two tales remain his crowning achievement, but in addition to being a writer of short stories, Irving was also an acclaimed essayist, travel writer, biographer, and historian.   This volume showcases Irving’s best work across a variety of genres, including whimsical newspaper articles about New York society, the theater, and contemporary fashions; charming travel pieces that evocatively weave together history and legend; humorous stories and satirical essays from The Sketch-Book and its sequel Bracebridge Hall, and excerpts from A History of New York, considered the first great American book of comic literature. The author’s success enabled him to earn a living by writing alone, unheard of for an American at that time.   Irving’s energetic, often tongue-in-cheek prose style, together with his ability to blend roguish satire, pathos, and picturesque description, had a profound influence upon the popular culture of his day. His writings have become a cornerstone in the foundation of the American literary tradition.   Peter Norberg received his Ph.D. from Rice University in 1998. Since 1997 he has been Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia.

Walter M. Miller,"Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz is a true landmark of twentieth-century literature -- a chilling and still-provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future.   In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes.

Wally Lamb,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap.Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control.Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it.But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Wally Lamb\I Know This Much Is True (43)\cover.jpg,9780060391621,1999-02-15T12:56:23+00:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"Family Life, Psychological, Fiction, General",I Know This Much Is True,43

Voltaire,"Candide, by Voltaire, is part of theBarnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works.One of the finest satires ever written, Voltaire''s Candide savagely skewers this very ""optimistic"" approach to life as a shamefully inadequate response to human suffering. The swift and lively tale follows the absurdly melodramatic adventures of the youthful Candide, who is forced into the army, flogged, shipwrecked, betrayed, robbed, separated from his beloved Cunégonde, and tortured by the Inquisition. As Candide experiences and witnesses calamity upon calamity, he begins to discover that--contrary to the teachings of his tutor, Dr. Pangloss--all is perhaps not always for the best. After many trials, travails, and incredible reversals of fortune, Candide and his friends finally retire together to a small farm, where they discover that the secret of happiness is simply ""to cultivate one''s garden,"" a philosophy that rejects excessive optimism and metaphysical speculation in favor of the most basic pragmatism. Filled with wit, intelligence, and an abundance of dark humor, Candide is relentless and unsparing in its attacks upon corruption and hypocrisy--in religion, government, philosophy, science, and even romance.

Victor Hugo & Golden Deer Classics,"The Hunchback of Notre Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris) is an 1831 French novel written by Victor Hugo. It is set in 1482 in Paris, in and around the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. The book tells the story of a poor barefoot Gypsy girl (La Esmeralda) and a misshapen bell-ringer (Quasimodo) who was raised by the Archdeacon (Claude Frollo). The book was written as a statement to preserve the Notre Dame cathedral and not to 'modernize' it, as Hugo was thoroughly against this. The story begins during the Renaissance in 1482, the day of the Festival of Fools in Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer, is introduced by his crowning as Pope of Fools. Esméralda, a beautiful 16-year-old gypsy with a kind and generous heart, captures the hearts of many men but especially Quasimodo's adopted father, Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his lust and the rules of the church. He orders Quasimodo to get her. Quasimodo is caught and whipped and ordered to be tied down in the heat. Esméralda seeing his thirst, offers him water.

There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to theexuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily uponMarija's broad shoulders--it was her task to see that all things went indue form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildlyhither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding andexhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to seethat others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself. Shehad left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at thehall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster. When thatpersonage had developed a will of his own in the matter, Marija hadflung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded totell him her opinion of him, first in Lithuanian, which he did notunderstand, and then in Polish, which he did. Having the advantage ofher in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured toattempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which, continuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm ofurchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile.This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door.The music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull""broom, broom"" of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which viedwith each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics. Seeingthe throng, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning theancestors of her coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage, plunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall. Once within, sheturned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime, ""Eik! Eik!Uzdaryk-duris!"" in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound likefairy music.""Z.

Or, simply, that quality we call 'the right stuff'?A monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space programme, and a dizzying dive into the sweat, fear, beauty and danger of being on the white-hot edge of history in the making.'Tom Wolfe at his very best...

Tom Rachman,"Set against the gorgeous backdrop of Rome, Tom Rachman's wry, vibrant debut follows the topsy-turvy private lives of the reporters, editors, and executives of an international English language newspaper as they struggle to keep it--and themselves--afloat.  Fifty years and many changes have ensued since the paper was founded by an enigmatic millionaire, and now, amid the stained carpeting and dingy office furniture, the staff's personal dramas seem far more important than the daily headlines. Kathleen, the imperious editor in chief, is smarting from a betrayal in her open marriage; Arthur, the lazy obituary writer, is transformed by a personal tragedy; Abby, the embattled financial officer, discovers that her job cuts and her love life are intertwined in a most unexpected way. Out in the field, a veteran Paris freelancer goes to desperate lengths for his next byline, while the new Cairo stringer is mercilessly manipulated by an outrageous war correspondent with an outsize ego. And in the shadows is the isolated young publisher who pays more attention to his prized basset hound, Schopenhauer, than to the fate of his family's quirky newspaper.  As the era of print news gives way to the Internet age and this imperfect crew stumbles toward an uncertain future, the paper's rich history is revealed, including the surprising truth about its founder's intentions.

Rainbow Six, however, goes beyond anything he has done before.  At its heart is John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL of Without Remorse and well-known from several of Clancy's novels as ""the dark side of Jack Ryan,"" the man who conducts the secret operational missions Ryan can have no part of. Whether hunting warlords in Japan, druglords in Colombia, or nuclear terrorists in the United States, Clark is efficient and deadly, but even he has ghosts in his past, demons that must be exorcised. And nothing is more demonic than the peril he must face in Rainbow Six: a group of terrorists like none the world has ever encountered before, a band of men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean the end of life on this earth as we know it. It is Tom Clancy's most shocking story ever--and closer to reality than any government would care to admit.

Dazed and confused, the man who only minutes before had been confirmed as the new Vice-President of the United States is told that he is now President. President John Patrick Ryan. And that is where Executive Orders begins. Ryan had agreed to accept the vice-presidency only as caretaker for a year, and now suddenly, an incalculable weight has fallen on his shoulders.

Thomas Paine,"`An army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot . . . it will march on the horizon of the world and it will conquer.' Thomas Paine was the first international revolutionary. His Common Sense (1776) was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution; his Rights of Man (1791-2) was the most famous defence of the French Revolution and sent out a clarion call for revolution throughout the world. He paid the price for his principles: he was outlawed in Britain, narrowly escaped execution in France, and was villified as an atheist and a Jacobin on his return to America. Paine loathed the unnatural inequalities fostered by the hereditary and monarchical systems. He believed that government must be by and for the people and must limit itself to the protection of their natural rights. But he was not a libertarian: from a commitment to natural rights he generated one of the first blueprints for a welfare state, combining a liberal order of civil rights with egalitarian constraints. This collection brings together Paine's most powerful political writings from the American and French revolutions in the first fully annotated edition of these works.

Thomas Paine,"This volume collects together the most important writings of founding father Thomas Paine. First published on January 10, 1776, ""Common Sense"" was one the most influential and best-selling works from the colonial period. One of the central political arguments amongst the colonists of the pre-revolutionary period was whether or not they should seek freedom from British rule. In ""Common Sense"", Paine provided a straightforward argument to the American people as to why they should seek independence. Second in this volume is ""The Crisis"", a collection of pamphlets published during the American Revolutionary war which were meant to inspire the soldiers and reinforce the reasons for the fight. Third is the ""Rights of Man"" a refutation of Edmund Burke's ""Reflections on the Revolution in France"" in which Paine argues that popular political revolution is necessary when a government does not protect the natural rights of its people. Fourth in this book is Paine's ""The Age of Reason"", a controversial work arguing for the philosophical position of Deism, which challenged institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. Lastly there is the socialist treatise ""Agrarian Justice"", in which Paine argues that land owners owe a rent to society in order to fund universal old-age and disability pensions as well as to provide a fixed sum to all citizens upon reaching maturity.

Thomas Hardy,"A heartaching portrayal of a woman faced by an impossible choice in the pursuit of happiness, Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is edited with notes by Tim Dolin and an introduction by Margaret R. Higonnet in Penguin Classics. When Tess Durbeyfield is driven by family poverty to claim kinship with the wealthy D'Urbervilles and seek a portion of their family fortune, meeting her 'cousin' Alec proves to be her downfall. A very different man, Angel Clare, seems to offer her love and salvation, but Tess must choose whether to reveal her past or remain silent in the hope of a peaceful future. With its sensitive depiction of the wronged Tess and powerful criticism of social convention, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, subtitled 'A Pure Woman', is one of the most moving and poetic of Hardy's novels. Based on the three-volume first edition that shocked readers when first published in 1891, this edition includes as appendices: Hardy's Prefaces, the Landscapes of Tess, episodes originally censored from the Graphic periodical version and a selection of the Graphic illustrations. Thomas Hardy (1840-1928), born Higher Brockhampton, near Dorchester, originally trained as an architect before earning his living as a writer. Though he saw himself primarily as a poet, Hardy was the author of some of the late eighteenth century's major novels: The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891), Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), and Jude the Obscure (1895). Amidst the controversy caused by Jude the Obscure, he turned to the poetry he had been writing all his life. In the next thirty years he published over nine hundred poems and his epic drama in verse, The Dynasts.

And so when Lord Ventinari, the city's benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport—soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in—so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic.   Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet's best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome . . .).

A year ago, Polly Perks's brother marched off to battle, and Polly's willing to resort to drastic measures to find him. So she cuts off her hair, dons masculine garb, and -- aided by a well-placed pair of socks -- sets out to join this man's army. Since a nation in such dire need of cannon fodder can't afford to be too picky, Polly is eagerly welcomed into the fighting fold—along with a vampire, a troll, an Igor, a religious fanatic, and two uncommonly close ""friends."" It would appear that Polly ""Ozzer"" Perks isn't the only grunt with a secret. But duty calls, the battlefield beckons. And now is the time for all good ... er ...

Terry Pratchett,"The Ankh-Morpork Post Office is running like . . . well, not at all like a government office. The mail is delivered promptly; meetings start and end on time; five out of six letters relegated to the Blind Letter Office ultimately wend their way to the correct addresses. Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations—including his own. So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, ""Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?""Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive.Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an ""analogy machine,"" has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (née Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk. Oh, and the chief clerk is probably a vampire.But before Moist has time to fully consider Vetinari's question, fate answers it for him. Now he's not only making money, but enemies too; he's got to spring a prisoner from jail, break into his own bank vault, stop the new manager from licking his face, and, above all, find out where all the gold has gone—otherwise, his life in banking, while very exciting, is going to be really, really short. . . .",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Terry Pratchett\Making Money (122)\cover.jpg,9780061161643,2007-09-18T14:06:48+01:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"Fiction - Fantasy, Fantasy:Humour, Fiction, Paper money, Fantasy - General, Discworld (Imaginary place), Science fiction, General, Fantasy fiction, Action & Adventure, Humorous fiction, Postal service, Science Fiction - General, Humorous, Fantasy, Ex-convicts",Making Money,122

Terry Brooks,"THE PHENOMENAL EPIC OF GOOD AND EVIL LIKE IT’S NEVER BEEN EXPERIENCED BEFORE   Thirty-five years ago, Terry Brooks brought to life a dazzling world in The Sword of Shannara. Nineteen more Shannara volumes would follow, making the series one of the most popular fantasy epics of all time. Now comes a fully annotated collector’s edition of the novel that started it all—featuring never-before-shared insights into the classic tale, an all-new introduction by the New York Times bestselling author, and replicas of the original sketches for some of the long-lost, black-and-white paintings by the Brothers Hildebrandt that decorated the original edition, and a replica of the original Hildebrandt central color plate on the back of the jacket..   Long ago, wars ravaged the world. In peaceful Shady Vale, half-elfin Shea Ohmsford knows little of such troubles. Then the giant, forbidding Allanon reveals that the supposedly dead Warlock Lord is plotting to destroy everything in his wake. The sole weapon against this Power of Darkness is the Sword of Shannara, which can be used only by a true heir of Shannara. On Shea, last of the bloodline, rests the hope of all the races.    Soon a Skull Bearer, dread minion of a mighty evil, flies into the Vale, seeking to destroy Shea. To save his home, Shea must flee, drawing the Skull Bearer after him in menacing pursuit.   Thus begins the enthralling Shannara epic, a spellbinding tale of adventure, magic, and myth.   PRAISE FOR TERRY BROOKS  “The Sword of Shannara is an unforgettable and wildly entertaining epic, animated by Terry Brooks’s cosmically generative imagination and storytelling joy. This was one of my favorite fictional worlds growing up, and I look forward to many return trips.”—Karen Russell, New York Times bestselling author of Swamplandia!“Terry Brooks has been my constant companion over a lifetime of exploring my beloved fantasy genre. I say with all honesty I would not be writing epic fantasy today if not for Shannara. If Tolkien is the grandfather of modern fantasy, Terry Brooks is its favorite uncle.”—Peter V. Brett, New York Times bestselling author of The Desert Spear   “I can’t even begin to count how many of Terry Brooks’s books I’ve read (and reread) over the years. From Shannara to Landover, his work was a huge part of my childhood.”—Patrick Rothfuss, New York Times bestselling author of The Name of the Wind   “Terry Brooks is a master of the craft and a trailblazer who established fantasy as a viable genre. Not only do I owe him for many hours of reading pleasure, I owe him my job. He is required reading.”—Brent Weeks, New York Times bestselling author of The Night Angel Trilogy   “The Shannara books were among the first to really capture my imagination.

Terry Brooks,"The legendary hero Allanon takes center stage in the first of three gripping new stand-alone eBook short stories set in the world of the fantasy-fiction phenomenon that is Shannara—by beloved New York Times bestselling author Terry Brooks.   The history is thus: The once-Druid Brona, seduced by his pursuit of dark magic, was forever transformed into the Warlock Lord—whose evil would be the downfall of the Four Lands and the death of the Races. Against him, the Elven King Jerle Shannara wielded the fabled sword that bore his surname and triumphed. Or so it was believed. But though the Dark Lord was driven out . . . he was not destroyed.   The Druid Allanon knows only too well the prophecy passed down to him by his late master: that eventually the Warlock Lord will return. Now, after hundreds of years, that day seems imminent. And the time is at hand for the Sword of Shannara to once more be brought forth from its sanctuary to serve its ancient purpose. All that remains is for a blood descendent of the Elven house of Shannara to carry the blade into battle.   With ever more portents of doom on the horizon, Allanon must seek out the last remaining Shannara heir, who alone will bear the burden of defending the Four Lands’ destiny. But with agents of darkness closing in from behind, unexpected enemies lying in wait ahead, and treachery encroaching on every side, there can be no certainty of success.

Sven Lindqvist,"Long before the word “genocide” was coined, the British invasion of Australia had annihilated approximately nine-tenths of the continent's original population of Aborigines. The creation of white Australia depended upon the legal fiction of “terra nullius”—no man's land—the claim that Aboriginal lands were inhabited by people who would soon die out and who could be helped on the way to extinction if they lingered.Sven Lindqvist, the widely acclaimed and internationally renowned author of “Exterminate All the Brutes” and A History of Bombing, brings his original sensibility to bear as he travels 7,000 miles through Australia in search of places where belief in the rights of the white man and the annihilation of the “lower races” were put into practice. While Australia continues to reckon with its violent past—echoed in the United States' treatment of Native Americans and Europe's colonization of other continents—Lindqvist evokes a shocking history in which young boys were kidnapped to dive for pearls, then whipped and abandoned when the bends ruined them for work; “half-caste” children were taken from their mothers; and natives were misdiagnosed with STDs, put in neck irons, and sent to internment camps on remote islands. Lindqvist also recalls the work of ethnologists who brought their own prejudices to bear in studying Aborigines as primitives close to the origins of civilization, later inspiring Freud and Durkheim. At the same time he describes a beautiful and strange land, sacred to the native people who had inhabited it for centuries and celebrated in a long tradition of richly symbolic art.A movingly idiosyncratic travelogue and a powerful act of historical excavation, Terra Nullius is the illuminating and disturbing story of how “no man's land” became the province of the white man.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Sven Lindqvist\Terra Nullius_ A Journey Through No (160)\cover.jpg,9781595580511,2007-02-15T13:37:36+00:00,New Press,,,1.0,"History, Australia & New Zealand",Terra Nullius: A Journey Through No One's Land,160

When the case is reopened after twenty years, a man - Michael Sutton - contacts private detective Kinsey Millhone for help. He claims to have recalled a strange and disturbing memory which just might provide the key to the mystery. He may have stumbled across the kidnappers burying Mary Claire Fitzhugh’s body . . . But Michael’s account is indistinct – he was only six years old at the time of the kidnapping; and even members of his family try to discredit his evidence. But Kinsey is certain there is something vital within Michael’s recollections. And even when what is eventually unearthed isn’t what anyone expected, she can’t quite let go of the case.

Sue Grafton,"tres¥pass \'trespes\ n: a transgression of law involving one's obligations to God or to one's neighbor; a violation of moral law; an offense; a sin -Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, Unabridged  In what may be her most unsettling novel to date, Sue Grafton's T is for Trespass is also her most direct confrontation with the forces of evil. Beginning slowly with the day-to-day life of a private eye, Grafton suddenly shifts from the voice of Kinsey Millhone to that of Solana Rojas, introducing readers to a chilling sociopath. Rojas is not her birth name. It is an identity she cunningly stole, an identity that gives her access to private caregiving jobs. The true horror of the novel builds with excruciating tension as the reader foresees the awfulness that lies ahead. The suspense lies in whether Millhone will realize what is happening in time to intervene.  Though set in the late eighties, T is for Trespass could not be more topical: identity theft; elder abuse; betrayal of trust; the breakdown in the institutions charged with caring for the weak and the dependent. It reveals a terrifying but all-too-real rip in the social fabric. Once again, Grafton opens up new territory with startling results.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Sue Grafton\T Is for Trespass (169)\cover.jpg,9780399154485,2007-02-15T13:36:01+00:00,G.P.

But P.I. Kinsey Millhone has promised Daisy she’ll try her best to locate Violet, dead or alive.

Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor. Meanwhile, the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against their own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighboring kingdoms. The great Edur fleet--its warriors selected from countless numbers of people--draws closer. Amongst the warriors are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer--each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar, must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that the soul might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, traveling with them is Scabandari's most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake.

STEVE MARTIN,"Steve Martin has been an international star for over thirty years. Here, for the first time, he looks back to the beginning of his career and charmingly evokes the young man he once was. Born in Texas but raised in California, Steve was seduced early by the comedy shows that played on the radio when the family travelled back and forth to visit relatives. When Disneyland opened just a couple of miles away from home, an enchanted Steve was given his first chance to learn magic and entertain an audience. He describes how he noted the reaction to each joke in a ledger - 'big laugh' or 'quiet' - and assiduously studied the acts of colleagues, stealing jokes when needed. With superb detail, Steve recreates the world of small, dark clubs and the fear and exhilaration of standing in the spotlight. While a philosophy student at UCLA, he worked hard at local clubs honing his comedy and slowly attracting a following until he was picked up to write for TV. From here on, Steve Martin became an acclaimed comedian, packing out venues nationwide. One night, however, he noticed empty seats and realised he had 'reached the top of the rollercoaster'.

Stephen King,"Don’t miss the thrilling novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King about what happens when the barrier between our world and that of the supernatural is breached...No more than a dark pencil line on a blank page. A horizon line, maybe. But also a slot for blackness to pour through... A terrible construction site accident takes Edgar Freemantle’s right arm and scrambles his memory and his mind, leaving him with little but rage as he begins the ordeal of rehabilitation. A marriage that produced two lovely daughters suddenly ends, and Edgar begins to wish he hadn’t survived the injuries that could have killed him. He wants out. His psychologist, Dr. Kamen, suggests a “geographic cure,” a new life distant from the Twin Cities and the building business Edgar grew from scratch. And Kamen suggests something else. “Edgar, does anything make you happy?” “I used to sketch.” “Take it up again. You need hedges...hedges against the night.” Edgar leaves Minnesota for a rented house on Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily undeveloped splinter of the Florida coast. The sun setting into the Gulf of Mexico and the tidal rattling of shells on the beach call out to him, and Edgar draws. A visit from Ilse, the daughter he dotes on, starts his movement out of solitude. He meets a kindred spirit in Wireman, a man reluctant to reveal his own wounds, and then Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old woman whose roots are tangled deep in Duma Key. Now Edgar paints, sometimes feverishly, his exploding talent both a wonder and a weapon. Many of his paintings have a power that cannot be controlled. When Elizabeth’s past unfolds and the ghosts of her childhood begin to appear, the damage of which they are capable is truly devastating.The tenacity of love, the perils of creativity, the mysteries of memory, and the nature of the supernatural—Stephen King gives us yet another novel as fascinating as it is gripping and terrifying.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Stephen King\Duma Key_ A Novel (266)\cover.jpg,9781416587910,2008-01-22T12:40:15+00:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"King, Fiction, Stephen - Prose & Criticism, Florida Keys (Fla.), Occult & Supernatural, supernatural, Horror fiction, Fiction - Horror, General, Occult, Mystery, Horror, Thrillers, Computers - Languages, Programming, Suspense, Accident victims",Duma Key: A Novel,266

Stephen King,"Stephen King's most gripping and unforgettable novel, Bag of Bones, is a story of grief and a lost love's enduring bonds, of a new love haunted by the secrets of the past, of an innocent child caught in a terrible crossfire. Set in the Maine territory King has made mythic, Bag of Bones recounts the plight of forty-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan, who is unable to stop grieving even four years after the sudden death of his wife, Jo, and who can no longer bear to face the blank screen of his word processor. Now his nights are plagued by vivid nightmares of the house by the lake. Despite these dreams, or perhaps because of them, Mike finally returns to Sara Laughs, the Noonans' isolated summer home. He finds his beloved Yankee town familiar on its surface, but much changed underneath -- held in the grip of a powerful millionaire, Max Devore, who twists the very fabric of the community to his purpose: to take his three-year-old granddaughter away from her widowed young mother. As Mike is drawn into their struggle, as he falls in love with both of them, he is also drawn into the mystery of Sara Laughs, now the site of ghostly visitations, ever-escalating nightmares, and the sudden recovery of his writing ability. What are the forces that have been unleashed here -- and what do they want of Mike Noonan? As vivid and enthralling as King's most enduring works, Bag of Bones resonates with what Amy Tan calls ""the witty and obsessive voice of King's powerful imagination.""

Stephen E. Ambrose,"In this riveting account, historian Stephen Ambrose continues where he left off in his #1 bestseller D-Day. Ambrose again follows the individual characters of this noble, brutal, and tragic war, from the high command down to the ordinary soldier, drawing on hundreds of interviews to re-create the war experience with startling clarity and immediacy. From the hedgerows of Normandy to the overrunning of Germany, Ambrose tells the real story of World War II from the perspective of the men and women who fought it. From June 7, 1944, on the beaches of Normandy to the final battles of Germany, acclaimed historian Stephen E. Ambrose draws on hundreds of interviews and oral histories from men on both sides to write a compelling and comprehensive portrait of the Citizen Soldiers who made up the U.S. Army. Ambrose re-creates the experiences of the individuals who fought the battle, from high command - Eisenhower, Bradley, and Patton - on down to the enlisted men. Within the chronological story, there are chapters on medics, nurses, and doctors; on the quartermasters; on the replacements; on what it was like to spend a night on the front lines; on sad sacks, cowards, and criminals; on Christmas 1944; and on weapons of all kinds. In this engrossing history, Ambrose reveals the learning process of a great army - how to cross rivers, how to fight in snow or hedgerows, how to fight in cities, how to coordinate air and ground campaigns, and how citizens become soldiers. Throughout, the perspective is that of the enlisted men and junior officers - and how decisions of the brass affected them.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Stephen E.

But upon its publication in 1895, when Crane was only twenty-four, Red Badge was heralded as a new kind of war novel, marked by astonishing insight into the true psychology of men under fire. Along with the seminal short stories included in this volume—“The Open Boat,” “The Veteran,” and “The Men in the Storm”—The Red Badge of Courage unleashed Crane’s deeply influential impressionistic style.

Sam Harris,"Sam Harris’s first book, The End of Faith, ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. In the aftermath, Harris discovered that most people—from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists—agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. Indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the primary justification for religious faith.In this highly controversial book, Sam Harris seeks to link morality to the rest of human knowledge. Defining morality in terms of human and animal well-being, Harris argues that science can do more than tell how we are; it can, in principle, tell us how we ought to be. In his view, moral relativism is simply false—and comes at an increasing cost to humanity. And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra, there can be no Christian or Muslim morality. Using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience, along with his experience on the front lines of our “culture wars,” Harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Sam Harris\The Moral Landscape_ How Science Ca (308)\cover.jpg,9781439171226,2011-09-13T14:42:51+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Religion, Philosophy & Social Aspects, Science, General, Sociology of Religion, Social Science, Ethics",The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values,308

It is inflating currency today at nearly a Weimar or Zimbabwe level, a practice that threatens to put us into an inflationary depression where $100 bills are worthless. What most people don't realize is that the Fed -- created by the Morgans and Rockefellers at a private club off the coast of Georgia -- is actually working against their own personal interests.

Now, in Book 2 of her most stunning trilogy yet, Hobb continues the soul-shattering tale of FitzChivalry Farseer. With rich characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, Golden Fool brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.Golden FoolPrince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible. Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock, bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly, Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.The problems are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets. Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread “beast magic.”Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process, they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous consequences for all.Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with the Fool brings him any solace.

Robin Hobb,"Enter the spellbinding world of dragons . . . and those who tend themOne of the most gifted fantasy authors writing today, New York Times bestselling author Robin Hobb has dazzled readers with brilliantly imaginative, emotionally resonant, and compulsively readable tales set in far-flung realms not unlike our own. In this enthralling new novel, she returns to the territory of her beloved Liveship Traders and Tawny Man trilogies with a story of dragons and humans, return and rebirth, and the search for meaning, belonging, and home.For years, the Trader cities valiantly battled their enemies, the Chalcedeans. But they could not have staved off invasion without the powerful dragon Tintaglia. In return, the Traders promised to help her serpents migrate up the Rain Wild River after a long exile at sea—to find a safe haven and, Tintaglia hopes, to restore her species. But too much time has passed, and the newly hatched dragons are damaged and weak, and many die. The few who survive cannot use their wings; earthbound, they are powerless to hunt and vulnerable to human predators willing to kill them for the fabled healing powers of dragon flesh.But Tintaglia has vanished and the Traders are weary of the labor and expense of tending useless dragons. The Trader leadership fears that if it stops providing for the young dragons, the hungry and neglected creatures will rampage—or die along the river's acidic muddy banks. To avert catastrophe, the dragons decree a move even farther up the treacherous river to Kelsingra, their ancient, mythical homeland whose mysterious location is locked deep within the dragons' uncertain ancestral memories.To ensure their safe passage, the Traders recruit a disparate group of young people to care for the damaged creatures and escort them to their new home. Among them is Thymara, an unschooled forest girl of sixteen, and Alise, a wealthy Trader's wife trapped in a loveless marriage, who attaches herself to the expedition as a dragon expert. The two women share a deep kinship with the dragons: Thymara can instinctively communicate with them, and Alise, captivated by their beauty and majesty, has devoted her life to studying them. Embarking on an arduous journey that holds no promise of return, the band of humans and dragons must make their way along the toxic and inhospitable Rain Wild River—an extraordinary odyssey that will teach them lessons about themselves and one another, as they experience hardships, betrayals, and joys beyond their wildest dreams.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Robin Hobb\Dragon Keeper_ Volume One of the Ra (325)\cover.jpg,9780061561627,2010-01-26T12:39:42+00:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"Fiction - Fantasy, Fiction, Fantasy - General, Epic, Fantasy fiction, General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Contemporary, Fantasy - Epic, Dragons, paranormal, Fantasy, Fairy Tales; Folk Tales; Legends & Mythology",Dragon Keeper: Volume One of the Rain Wilds Chronicles,325
Robin Hobb,"The acclaimed New York Times bestselling author of Dragon Keeper returns with a second enthralling tale of dragons and humans, adventure and discovery, love and freedom   Centuries had passed since dragons last roamed the war-torn world of the Rain Wild River. But as peace once again settled upon the land, a lost generation of sea serpents—ancient, half-starved, and weary—returned to cocoon, certain that they would be reborn as the beautiful and powerful dragons of legend. But their arduous journey exacted a heavy toll, and the proud serpents emerged as sickly, half-formed beasts, unable to fly or hunt . . . or thrive. For years now they have been trapped on a swampy riverbank between forest and river, hungry and barely alive, reliant on humans to provide for them.   With their survival at stake, fifteen dragons—among them the wise golden Mercor, the haughty and dazzling silver-blue queen Sintara, and the delicate copper beauty Relpda—have set off on a dangerous trek into the unknown, up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering the ancient Elderling city of Kelsingra, the lost haven for dragons and Elderlings alike. The dragons are accompanied by a disparate group of human keepers, rejects from Rain Wild society. They, too, yearn to find Kelsingra and create a home of their own, one in which they may make their own rules and decide their own fate. But is Kelsingra real or merely a fragment of a glorified past buried deep in the dragons' shared memories? No map exists to guide them, and the noble creatures find their ancient recollections of little use in a land changed by generations of flooding and seismic chaos.   As the dragons, the humans—including the strong and defiant Rain Wild girl Thymara; the wealthy dragon scholar and Trader's wife, Alise; and her companion, the urbane Sedric—and their magical supply barge, captained by the gruff Leftrin, forge their way ever deeper into uncharted wilderness, human and beast alike discover they are changing in mysterious and dangerous ways. While the bonds between them solidify, starvation, flashfloods, and predators will imperil them all. But dragons and humans soon learn that the most savage threats come from within their own company . . . and not all of them may survive.

Apresentando a tese central de cada uma delas, reflete também sobre a metodologia que criaram, comparando-a ao método epistemológico. Por fim, define o projeto arqueológico em todas as etapas de sua trajetória e situa-o em relação às pesquisas desenvolvidas em seguida por Foucault, sob o nome de genealogia. A presente edição, revista e ampliada à luz dos desenvolvimentos posteriores à morte de Foucault, reafirma a importância desse livro no campo dos estudos da filosofia do grande pensador francês.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Roberto Machado\Foucault, a ciencia e o saber (329)\cover.jpg",,2015-08-03T04:00:00+01:00,Lelivros,,,1.0,,"Foucault, a ciência e o saber",329

Robert Leckie,"Here is one of the most riveting first-person accounts ever to come out of World War II. Robert Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in January 1942, shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In Helmet for My Pillow we follow his odyssey, from basic training on Parris Island, South Carolina, all the way to the raging battles in the Pacific, where some of the war's fiercest fighting took place. Recounting his service with the 1st Marine Division and the brutal action on Guadalcanal, New Britain, and Peleliu, Leckie spares no detail of the horrors and sacrifices of war, painting an unvarnished portrait of how real warriors are made, fight, and often die in the defense of their country.       From the live-for-today rowdiness of marines on leave to the terrors of jungle warfare against an enemy determined to fight to the last man, Leckie describes what war is really like when victory can only be measured inch by bloody inch. Woven throughout are Leckie's hard-won, eloquent, and thoroughly unsentimental meditations on the meaning of war and why we fight. Unparalleled in its immediacy and accuracy, Helmet for My Pillow will leave no reader untouched. This is a book that brings you as close to the mud, the blood, and the experience of war as it is safe to come.

Robert J. Sawyer,"Calculating God is the new near-future SF thriller from the popular and award-winning Robert J. Sawyer. An alien shuttle craft lands outside the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. A six-legged, two-armed alien emerges, who says, in perfect English, ""Take me to a paleontologist."" It seems that Earth, and the alien's home planet, and the home planet of another alien species traveling on the alien mother ship, all experienced the same five cataclysmic events at about the same time (one example of these ""cataclysmic events"" would be the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs). Both alien races believe this proves the existence of God: i.e. he's obviously been playing with the evolution of life on each of these planets.From this provocative launch point, Sawyer tells a fast-paced, and morally and intellectually challenging, SF story that just grows larger and larger in scope. The evidence of God's universal existence is not universally well received on Earth, nor even immediately believed. And it reveals nothing of God's nature. In fact. it poses more questions than it answers.When a supernova explodes out in the galaxy but close enough to wipe out life on all three home-worlds, the big question is, Will God intervene or is this the sixth cataclysm:?Calculating God is SF on the grand scale.Calculating God is a 2001 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Robert J.

Enter Chief of Police Jeff Talley, a stressed-out former LAPD SWAT negotiator who is hiding from his past. Plunged back into the high-pressure world that he desperately wants to forget, Talley soon learns that his nightmare has only begun. The hostages are not who they seem, and the home contains secrets that even L.A.’s most lethal and volatile crime lord, Sonny Benza, fears. As Talley tries to hold himself together and save the people inside, the full weight of Benza’s wrath descends on him, putting the police chief and his own family at risk.

Robert A. Heinlein,"Robert A. Heinlein was the most influential science fiction writer of his era, an influence so large that, as Samuel R. Delany notes, ""modern critics attempting to wrestle with that influence find themselves dealing with an object rather like the sky or an ocean."" He won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, a record that still stands. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was the last of these Hugo-winning novels, and it is widely considered his finest work.It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of the former Lunar penal colony against the Lunar Authority that controls it from Earth. It is the tale of the disparate people--a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic--who become the rebel movement's leaders. And it is the story of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to this inner circle, and who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is one of the high points of modern science fiction, a novel bursting with politics, humanity, passion, innovative technical speculation, and a firm belief in the pursuit of human freedom.The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the winner of the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novel.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Robert A.

This doomsday scenario confronted a biohazard SWAT team struggling in secret to stop the outbreak of an exotic ""hot"" virus at an Army research facility outside Washington. ""The Hot Zone"" tells the dramatic story of their dangerous race against time, along with an alarming account of how previously unknown viruses that have lived undetected in the rain forest for eons are now entering human populations. From the airlocked confines of a biosafety level 4 military lab, to an airliner over Kenya carrying a passenger dissolving into a human virus bomb, to a deserted jungle cave alive with deadly virus, THE HOT ZONE is a non-fiction thriller like no other.

Native Son tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic.

An artist, safecracker, practical joker and storyteller, Feynman's life was a series of combustible combinations made possible by his unique mixture of high intelligence, unquenchable curiosity and eternal skepticism. Over a period of years, Feynman's conversations with his friend Ralph Leighton were first taped and then set down as they appear here, little changed from their spoken form, giving a wise, funny, passionate and totally honest self-portrait of one of the greatest men of our age.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Richard Phillips Feynman\_Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

Try and get above the weather in anything more sophisticated than a helicopter and the Martian orbital platforms will burn you out of the sky. And death doesn't just wait for you in the seas and the skies. On land, from the tropical beaches and swamps of Kossuth to the icy, machine-infested wastes of New Hokkaido the hard won gains of the Quellist revolution have been lost.

Richard Dawkins,"Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This 30th anniversary edition of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights, and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Richard Dawkins\The Selfish Gene_ 30th Anniversary (443)\cover.jpg,9780199291151,2006-03-16T13:30:29+00:00,OUP Oxford,,,1.0,"Mathematics, Game Theory, Science, General, Life Sciences, Evolution, Genetics & Genomics",The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition,443

Richard Dawkins,"In 2008, a Gallup poll showed that 44 percent of Americans believed God had created man in his present form within the last 10,000 years. In a Pew Forum poll in the same year, 42 percent believed that all life on earth has existed in its present form since the beginning of time.  In 1859 Charles Darwin's masterpiece, On the Origin of Species, shook society to its core. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke. But he surely would have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity. Now the author of the iconic work The God Delusion takes them to task.  The Greatest Show on Earth is a stunning counterattack on advocates of ""Intelligent Design,"" explaining the evidence for evolution while exposing the absurdities of the creationist ""argument."" Dawkins sifts through rich layers of scientific evidence: from living examples of natural selection to clues in the fossil record; from natural clocks that mark the vast epochs wherein evolution ran its course to the intricacies of developing embryos; from plate tectonics to molecular genetics. Combining these elements and many more, he makes the airtight case that ""we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a blossoming and flourishing tree of life and it is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random selection.""  The Greatest Show on Earth comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is menacing as never before. In American schools, and in schools around the world, insidious attempts are made to undermine the status of science in the classroom. Dawkins wields a devastating argument against this ignorance, but his unjaded passion for the natural world turns what might have been a negative argument into a positive offering to the reader: nothing less than a master's vision of life, in all its splendor.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Richard Dawkins\The Greatest Show on Earth_ The Evi (445)\cover.jpg,9781416594789,2009-09-22T14:40:44+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Evolution, Science, Biology, Life Sciences, Biological Diversity, #genre",The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,445

The images, ideas, sounds and scents that abound in this phantasmagoric sideshow are provocative and powerful: the mournful cries of celestial travelers cast out cruelly into a vast, empty space of stars and blackness ... the sight of gray dust settling over a forgotten outpost on a road that leads nowhere ... the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works.   As an adolescent America searched for its unique identity among the nations of the world, a number of thinkers and writers emerged eager to share their vision of what the American character could be. Among their leaders was Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose essays, lectures, and poems defined the American transcendentalist movement, though he himself disliked the term. Emerson advocates a rejection of fear-driven conformity, a total independence of thought and spirit, and a life lived in harmony with nature. He believes that Truth lies within each individual, for each is part of a greater whole, a universal “over-soul” through which we transcend the merely mortal. Emerson was extremely prolific throughout his life; his collected writings fill forty volumes. This edition contains his major works, including Nature, the essays “Self-Reliance,” “The American Scholar,” “The Over-Soul,” “Circles,” “The Poet,” and “Experience,”, and such important poems as “The Rhodora,” “Uriel,” “The Humble-Bee,” “Earth-Song,” “Give All to Love,” and the well-loved “Concord Hymn.” Includes a comprehensive glossary of names. Peter Norberg has been Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia since 1997.

Portia de Rossi,"“I didn’t decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .” Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying. In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn’t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point. Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder. From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues. In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject.

Paula McLain,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.  Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they've fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Paula McLain\The Paris Wife_ A Novel (496)\cover.jpg,9780345521309,2011-02-15T13:43:14+00:00,Ballantine Books,,,1.0,"Fiction, Authors, American, Biographical, Expatriate authors, Authors' spouses, Historical, General, France, United States, Education, Paris (France)",The Paris Wife: A Novel,496

Now, for the first time, they are available in electronic book format, so a whole new generation of readers can be swept away on the adventure of a lifetime. This is the tenth book in the series. It is still the War of 1812. Patrick O’Brian takes his hero Jack Aubrey and his tetchy, sardonic friend Stephen Maturin on a voyage as fascinating as anything he has ever written. They set course across the South Atlantic to intercept a powerful American frigate outward bound to play havoc with the British whaling trade. If they do not come up with her before she rounds the Horn, they must follow her into the Great South Sea and as far across the Pacific as she may lead them. It is a commission after Jack’s own heart. Maturin has fish of his own to fry in the world of secret intelligence. Aubrey has to cope with a succession of disasters – men overboard, castaways, encounters with savages, storms, typhoons, groundings, shipwrecks, to say nothing of murder and criminal insanity. That the enemy is in fact faithfully dealt with, no one who has the honour of Captain Aubrey’s acquaintance can take leave to doubt.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Patrick O'brian\The Far Side of the World (Aubrey_M (514)\cover.jpg,9780007429370,2011-12-19T12:45:04+00:00,HarperCollins UK,,,1.0,"Fiction, Historical, General, Epic, Action & Adventure, Thrillers, Historical fiction, Military, Suspense, Fantasy","The Far Side of the World (Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 10)",514
Patrick O'Brian,"Having survived a long and desperate adventure in the Great South Sea, Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin return to England to very different circumstances. For Jack it is a happy homecoming, at least initially, but for Stephen disastrous: his little daughter appears to be autistic, incapable of speech or contact, while his wife, Diana, unable to bear this situation, has disappeared, her house being looked after by the widowed Clarissa Oakes. Much of The Commodore takes place on land, in sitting rooms and drafty castles, but the roar of the great guns is never far from our hearing. Aubrey and Maturin are sent on a bizarre decoy mission to the fever-ridden lagoons of the Gulf of Guinea to suppress the slave trade, but their ultimate destination is Ireland. There the French are mounting an invasion that will test Aubrey's seamanship and Maturin's resourcefulness as a secret intelligence agent, and the climax of the story is one of those grand and thrilling fleet actions on which the supremacy of the British Navy was founded.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Patrick O'Brian\The Commodore (515)\cover.jpg,9780393037609,1995-02-15T13:39:27+00:00,W.W.

Their comfortable existence, however, is cut short when Jack is overnight reduced to a pauper with enough debts to keep him in prison for life.

About the eBook:  
A storm is coming to Cliffside, California, and with it comes a killer.  

His name is Clay Saunders, and he walks in two worlds. Born with a caul, Saunders sees ghosts. But to him, the world of the dead is very much like the world of the living. It's a realm of eternal pain -- inescapable and relentless -- that cuts as deeply as the razor edge of the hired killer's K-bar knife.  

Saunders has spilled blood on Florida sand, and the snow-covered Canadian prairie, and the black lava of Hawaii. His latest target is Diabolos Whistler, leader of a satanic cult. Exiled in Mexico, Whistler is alone when Saunders stabs him just above the first vertebrae... alone, except for the mummies stacked like so much cordwood in his library.  

But the living who await the killer's arrival in Cliffside are more frightening than the decayed corpses of the dead. There's Whistler's daughter Circe, a tattooed siren who leads Saunders to a bed of iron and satin...and Circe's bodyguard, a seven foot student of Egyptology whose sarcophagus rests in a redwood pyramid... and Janice Ravenwood, a new age medium with a startling hidden gift.  

And there's a little girl, a ghost held prisoner by vengeful revenants. Only Clay Saunders can save her. To do that, he must bridge the worlds of the living and the dead in an unforgettable climax of darkness and blood.

Norman Partridge,"Norman Partridge's Halloween novel, Dark Harvest, was chosen as one of Publishers Weekly's 100 Best Books of 2006. A Bram Stoker Award winner and World Fantasy nominee, Partridge's rapid-fire tale of a small town trapped by its own shadows welcomed a wholly original creation, the October Boy, earning the author comparisons to Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Shirley Jackson.Now Partridge revisits Halloween with a collection featuring a half-dozen stories celebrating frights both past and present. In ""The Jack o' Lantern,"" a brand new Dark Harvest novelette, the October Boy races against a remorseless döppelganger bent on carving a deadly path through the town's annual ritual of death and rebirth. ""Johnny Halloween"" features a sheriff battling both a walking ghost and his own haunted conscience. In ""Three Doors,"" a scarred war hero hunts his past with the help of a magic prosthetic hand, while ""Satan's Army"" is a real Partridge rarity previously available only in a long sold-out lettered edition from another press.But there's more to this holiday celebration besides fiction. ""The Man Who Killed Halloween"" is an extensive essay about growing up during the late sixties in the town where the Zodiac Killer began his murderous spree. In an introduction that explores monsters both fictional and real, Partridge recalls what it was like to live in a community menaced by a serial killer and examines how the Zodiac's reign of terror shaped him as a writer.Halloween night awaits. Join a master storyteller as he explores the layers of darkness that separate all-too-human evil from the supernatural. Let Norman Partridge lead you on seven journeys through the most dangerous night of the year, where no one is safeŠand everyone is suspect.* Praise for the Author's Work:""Partridge has always had a knack for sifting deeper significance from period pop culture, but here he brilliantly distills a convincing male identity myth from teen rebel drive-in flicks, garish comic book horrors, hard-boiled crime pulps and other bits of lowbrow Americana. Whether read as potent dark fantasy or a modern coming-of-age parable, this is contemporary American writing at its finest."" - Publishers Weekly (starred review of Dark Harvest)""Partridge is at his best when he combines graphic terror with teenage angst... No one evokes the nostalgia of growing up in the 1960s better... If you're looking for a scary Halloween tale, with lots of blood and gore‹and candy‹you've come to the right place."" - Rocky Mountain News""Dark Harvest thrills with staccato scenes of action, ideal for a horror novel. Using a quick, lean prose reminiscent of the finest Gold Medal-era fiction and, at the same time, as fresh as a Quentin Tarantino film, Partridge packs more into this slim volume than most authors do in a bloated 600-page epic."" - The Austin Chronicle""Norman Partridge is the finest writer of short horror fiction going."" - RevolutionSF""This wonderful writer offers challenges, surprises, and deep satisfactions to anyone willing to think about what they are reading. Partridge consistently writes as though his life depends on the words he sets down on the page."" - Peter Straub""Norman Partridge displays his unique ability to give a reader all the kick-ass pleasure of pulp suspense and action along with vibrant, complex characters and deep insight into the mythic hearts of distinctly American Nightmares."" - Jeffrey Ford""Norman Partridge pulls no punches whether he¹s writing hard-boiled westerns, contemporary noir, or monster tales‹often combined. His stories will take you on a helluva ride."" - Ellen Datlow""Any new book with the name ŒNorman Partridge¹ on the front is cause for celebration."" - Duane Swierczynski""Norm Partridge is an extraordinary storyteller and his welding of noir and horror has created a signature style renowned for its lean, sinewy power."" - Laird Barron""Norman Partridge writes as if the devil himself had a sawed-off shotgun pointed at his head."" - Joe Schreiber""Norman Partridge has such a wealth of talent‹a prose style of wondrous luminosity and grace; a narrative drive that carries the reader inexorably to the spectacular climax; an ability to convey violence and gruesomeness without the least suggestion of crudity or exploitation; and an imagination that opens new worlds to all who venture within his realm‹that it will be engaging to chart his course in the future."" - S.

Orson Scott Card,"From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game is the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war.  In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.THE ENDER UNIVERSEEnder Quintet seriesEnder’s Game / Ender in Exile / Speaker for the Dead / Xenocide / Children of the MindEnder’s Shadow seriesEnder’s Shadow / Shadow of the Hegemon / Shadow Puppets / Shadow of the Giant / Shadows in FlightChildren of the FleetThe First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)Earth Unaware / Earth Afire / Earth AwakensThe Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)The Swarm /The HiveEnder novellasA War of Gifts /First Meetings",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Orson Scott Card\Ender's Game (547)\cover.jpg,9780812550702,1994-07-15T13:41:50+01:00,Tom Doherty Associates,,,1.0,"Space warfare, General, Space Opera, Military, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, Ender, orson_scott_card, English 10, scifi, Ender (Fictitious character), War games, High Tech, Genetic engineering, Peter (Fictitious character), Brothers and sisters, Science Fiction - General, Fiction, American, Fiction - Science Fiction, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Science fiction, Child soldiers, Action & Adventure, English 8, Wiggin",Ender's Game,547

Octavia E. Butler,"As the acclaimed Patternist science fiction series begins, two immortals meet in the long-ago past—and mankind’s destiny is changed forever. For a thousand years, Doro has cultivated a small African village, carefully breeding its people in search of seemingly unattainable perfection. He survives through the centuries by stealing the bodies of others, a technique he has so thoroughly mastered that nothing on Earth can kill him. But when a gang of New World slavers destroys his village, ruining his grand experiment, Doro is forced to go west and begin anew. He meets Anyanwu, a centuries-old woman whose means of immortality are as kind as his are cruel. She is a shapeshifter, capable of healing with a kiss, and she recognizes Doro as a tyrant. Though many humans have tried to kill them, these two demi-gods have never before met a rival. Now they begin a struggle that will last centuries and permanently alter the nature of humanity. Hugo and Nebula award–winning author Octavia E.

Norman Partridge,"Norman Partridge's Halloween novel, Dark Harvest, was chosen as one of Publishers Weekly's 100 Best Books of 2006. A Bram Stoker Award winner and World Fantasy nominee, Partridge's rapid-fire tale of a small town trapped by its own shadows welcomed a wholly original creation, the October Boy, earning the author comparisons to Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Shirley Jackson.Now Partridge revisits Halloween with a collection featuring a half-dozen stories celebrating frights both past and present. In ""The Jack o' Lantern,"" a brand new Dark Harvest novelette, the October Boy races against a remorseless döppelganger bent on carving a deadly path through the town's annual ritual of death and rebirth. ""Johnny Halloween"" features a sheriff battling both a walking ghost and his own haunted conscience. In ""Three Doors,"" a scarred war hero hunts his past with the help of a magic prosthetic hand, while ""Satan's Army"" is a real Partridge rarity previously available only in a long sold-out lettered edition from another press.But there's more to this holiday celebration besides fiction. ""The Man Who Killed Halloween"" is an extensive essay about growing up during the late sixties in the town where the Zodiac Killer began his murderous spree. In an introduction that explores monsters both fictional and real, Partridge recalls what it was like to live in a community menaced by a serial killer and examines how the Zodiac's reign of terror shaped him as a writer.Halloween night awaits.

Whether read as potent dark fantasy or a modern coming-of-age parable, this is contemporary American writing at its finest."" - Publishers Weekly (starred review of Dark Harvest)""Partridge is at his best when he combines graphic terror with teenage angst... No one evokes the nostalgia of growing up in the 1960s better... If you're looking for a scary Halloween tale, with lots of blood and gore‹and candy‹you've come to the right place."" - Rocky Mountain News""Dark Harvest thrills with staccato scenes of action, ideal for a horror novel. Using a quick, lean prose reminiscent of the finest Gold Medal-era fiction and, at the same time, as fresh as a Quentin Tarantino film, Partridge packs more into this slim volume than most authors do in a bloated 600-page epic."" - The Austin Chronicle""Norman Partridge is the finest writer of short horror fiction going."" - RevolutionSF""This wonderful writer offers challenges, surprises, and deep satisfactions to anyone willing to think about what they are reading.

*In a small California town, a carnival roustabout takes a one-way road to vengeance behind the wheel of a car once owned by a notorious serial killer.*
*In Hollywood, a struggling actor makes a desperate play for the biggest of scores at a “dead celebrities” costume party.*
*In the Mojave Desert, a musician stalks his own ghost and the devil woman who stole it.*
*In Hawaii, a disillusioned businessman discovers the true power of a myth at a forgotten shrine.*
*In the Deep South, a crazed Elvis impersonator encounters a man who dares to dishonor the King's name.*
*In the Old west, a gunslinging demon battles a witch and a cursed outlaw gang.*
Tales of supernatural horror, dark suspense, gruesome irony, and the just-plain fantastic... twisted characters with decidedly different yet all-too-believable viewpoints... places you may have visited but have never seen clearly until now... tough yet strangely poetic prose... in-your-face shocks and nitro-laced plot twists you won't soon forget... two brand new stories, an unpublished original comic script, story notes, and an introduction by multi-talented author Joe R. Lansdale: it's all here in Bad Intentions, the long-awaited first full-length short story collection by Bram Stoker Award-winner Norman Partridge, a writer Stephen King calls “a major new talent.”
### Amazon.com Review
Norman Partridge's first story collection, *Mr. Fox and Other Feral Tales,* won a Bram Stoker Award, and his first novel, *Slippin' Into Darkness* , garnered the highest praise from horror critics; so it's no surprise that this second collection is a knockout. Here, in dusty Southwestern settings with tawdry glimmers of pop culture, you'll find carnival roustabouts, an Elvis impersonator, a demon gunslinger, a *gorilla* gunslinger, monstrous automobiles, a heavyweight champ who's past his prime--all of them flirting with death, if not damnation, too. The fragmented narratives are at times a little befuddling, but the writing is lean and evocative, like Dennis Etchison or Jim Thompson. As Joe R.

J. D. Robb,"New York City of 2059 'Murder was always an insult, and had been since the first human hand had smashed a stone into the first human skull. But the murder, bloody and brutal, of an entire family in their own home, in their own beds, was a different form of evil. No affairs. No criminal connections. No DNA. No clues. Eve Dallas may be the best cop in the city -- not to mention having the lavish resources of her husband, Roarke, at her disposal -- but the Swisher case has her baffled. On the surface Keelie and Grant Swisher seem unlikely targets for an assassin; an average couple living in a nice neighbourhood and working hard to raise their two kids. But when Eve Dallas is called to a multiple homicide at the Swisher family home, she discovers a blood-bath. There are five dead - including two children - in what seems to be a professional hit. The killers breached an elaborate state-of-the-art security system, and the killers used night-vision equipment to find their way through the cozy, middle-class house. With brutal, military precision, they slashed the throat of each victim while they slept in their beds; and were in and out of the house in less than ten minutes. Clearly, Eve is dealing with pros. In fact they made only one mistake... they left a survivor. They overlooked the nine-year-old girl cowering in the darkened kitchen. Nixie Swisher's sudden urge for a midnight snack may just have saved her life. While her parents, brother and best-friend lay in their beds, oblivious to the threat, Nixie was downstairs in the kitchen getting a soda... and she saw far too much. Kids are not Dallas's strong suit. But Now Nixie Swisher is an orphan-and the sole eyewitness to a seemingly inexplicable crime, and Dallas needs to solve this case. Eve knows that her priority is to keep her safe. Offering her a temporary refuge is easy, but dealing with the emotional needs of a nine-year-old girl who has lost everything isn't. Not only for the cause of justice. With her partner, Peabody, back on the job-and her husband, Roarke, providing the kind of help that only he can give-Lieutenant Eve Dallas is running after shadows, and dead-set on finding out who's behind them. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories -- and deepest fears. But she's chasing professionals who don't like leaving loose ends. And leaving Nixie Swisher alive is one loose end too many.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J. D. Robb\Survivor in Death (565)\cover.jpg,9780399152085,2005-02-15T13:35:49+00:00,G.P.

But as ever, some murders receive more attention than others-especially those in which the victim is a prominent businessman, found in his Park Avenue apartment, tied to the bed-and strangled- with cords of black velvet.  It doesn&#39;t surprise Lieutenant Eve Dallas that Thomas Anders&#39;s scandalous death is a source of titillation and speculation to the public-and of humiliation to his family. But while people in the city are talking about it, those close to Anders aren&#39;t so anxious to do the same. With some help from her billionaire husband, Roarke, Eve&#39;s soon knocking on doors-or barging through them-to find answers.  But the facts don&#39;t add up. Physical evidence suggests that the victim didn&#39;t struggle. The security breach in the apartment indicates that the killer was someone known to the family, but everyone&#39;s alibi checks out.

J. D. Robb,"Ancient church rituals meet cutting- edge crime solving in the latest novel in the #1 New York Times–bestselling series that’s “Law &amp; Order: SVU—in the future” (Entertainment Weekly).In the year 2060, sophisticated investigative tools can help catch a killer. But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer.Ridley Pearson has praised J. D. Robb’s suspense as “taut” and “nerve-jangling.” Her latest thriller sets a new standard for suspense, as the priest at a Catholic funeral mass brings the chalice to his lips—and falls over dead.When Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas confirms that the consecrated wine contained potassium cyanide, she’s determined to solve the murder of Father Miguel Flores, despite her discomfort with her surroundings. It’s not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke. It’s all that holiness flying around at St. Christobal’s that makes her uneasy.A search of the victim’s sparsely furnished room reveals little— except for a carefully hidden religious medal with a mysterious inscription, and a couple of underlined Bible passages. The autopsy reveals more: faint scars of knife wounds, a removed tattoo—and evidence of plastic surgery, suggesting that “Father Flores” may not have been the man his parishioners had thought. Now, as Eve pieces together clues that hint at gang connections and a deeply personal act of revenge, she believes she’s making progress on the case. Until a second murder—in front of an even larger crowd of worshippers—knocks the whole investigation sideways. And Eve is left to figure out who committed these unholy acts—and why.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J. D. Robb\Salvation in Death (568)\cover.jpg,9780399155222,2008-02-15T13:29:05+00:00,G.P.

It doesn't leave Eve a lot of leftover time to put together a baby shower for her buddy Mavis, but that's supposedly what friends are for. Now Mavis needs another favor. Tandy Willowby, one of the moms-to-be in Mavis's birthing class, didn't show up for the shower. A recent emigrant from London, Tandy has few friends in New York, and no family-and she was really looking forward to the party. And when Eve enters Tandy's apartment and finds a gift for Mavis's shower wrapped and ready on the table-and a packed bag for the hospital still on the floor next to it-tingling runs up and down her spine. Normally, such a case would be turned over to Missing Persons. But Mavis wants no one else on the job but Eve-and Eve can't say no. She'll have to track Tandy down while simultaneously unearthing the deals and double-crosses hidden in the files of some of the city's richest and most secretive citizens, in a race against this particularly vicious killer.

Noam Chomsky & Institute Professor & Professor Of Linguistics (emeritus) Noam Chomsky,"The Chomsky Reader brings together for the first time the political thought of American's leading dissident intellectual--""arguably the most important intellectual alive"" (The New York Times).  At the center of practically every major debate over America's role in the world, one finds Noam Chomsky's ideas--sometimes attacked, sometimes studiously ignored, but always a powerful presence.  Drawing from his published and unpublished work, The Chomsky Reader reveals the awesome range of this ever-critical mind--from global questions of war and peace to the most intricate questions of human intelligence, IQ, and creativity. It reveals the underlying radical coherency of his view of the world--from his enormously influential attacks on America's role in Vietnam to his perspective on Nicaragua and Central America today. Chomsky's challenge to accepted wisdom about Israel and the Palestinians has caused a furor in America, as have his trenchant essays on the real nature of terrorism in our age. No one has dissected more graphically the character of the Cold War consensus and the way it benefits the two superpowers, or argued more thoughtfully for a shared elitist ethos in liberalism and communism. No one has exposed more logically America's acclaimed freedoms as masking irresponsible power and unjustified privilege, or argued quite so insistently that the ""free press"" is part of a stultifying conformity that pervades all aspects of American intellectual life.

Nick Bostrom,"The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations.

Nicholas Sparks,"There are a few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he'd never do: he'd never leave New York City; never give his heart away again after barely surviving one failed marriage; and, most of all, never become a parent. Now, Jeremy is living in the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, married to Lexie Darnell, the love of his life, and anticipating the birth of their daughter. But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, an unsettling and mysterious message re-opens old wounds and sets off a chain of events that will forever change the course of this young couple's marriage. Dramatic, heartbreaking and surprising, this is a story about the love between a man and a woman and between a parent and a child. More than that, it is a story that beautifully portrays how the same emotion that can break your heart is also the one that will ultimately heal it.While the novel picks up the tale of Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh that started in True Believer and will delight fans of that novel, it stands on its own as one of Nicholas Sparks's most deeply moving love stories.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Nicholas Sparks\At First Sight (606)\cover.jpg,9780446401265,2007-09-01T13:17:23+01:00,Grand Central Publishing,,,1.0,"Fiction, Romance - Contemporary, General, Contemporary, Married people, Suspense fiction, Detective and mystery stories, North Carolina, American Light Romantic Fiction, Fiction - General, Pregnant women, Romance: Modern, Suspense, Romance",At First Sight,606

Niccolò Machiavelli,"Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that dispels some of the myths associated with Machiavelli, and considers the true purpose of The Prince. - ;'A prince must not have any other object nor any other thought...but war, its institutions, and its discipline; because that is the only art befitting one who commands.' When Machiavelli's brief treatise on Renaissance statecraft and princely power was posthumously published in 1532, it generated a debate that has raged unabated until the present day. Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. Machiavelli added a dimension of incisive realism to one of the major philosophical and political issues of his time, especially the relationship between public deeds and private morality. His book provides a remarkably uncompromising picture of the true nature of power, no matter in what era or by whom it is exercised. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that considers the true purpose of The Prince and dispels some of the myths associated with it. - ;Literary scholar Peter Bondanella rightly seeks the cold elegance and readability of the original.

According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world's last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins.

Hostilities are suddenly moving to a new and more volatile level, as Half-Cocked Jack plots a daring assault on the Tower itself, aiming for nothing less than the total corruption of Britain's newborn monetary system.Unbeknownst to all, it is love that set the Coiner on his traitorous course; the desperate need to protect the woman of his heart -- the remarkable Eliza, Duchess of Arcachon-Qwghlm -- from those who would destroy her should he fail. Meanwhile, Daniel Waterhouse and his Clubb of unlikely cronies comb city and country for clues to the identity of the blackguard who is attempting to blow up Natural Philosophers with Infernal Devices -- as political factions jockey for position while awaiting the impending death of the ailing queen; as the ""holy grail"" of alchemy, the key to life eternal, tantalizes and continues to elude Isaac Newton, yet is closer than he ever imagined; as the greatest technological innovation in history slowly takes shape in Waterhouse's manufactory.Everything that was will be changed forever ...The System of the World is the concluding volume in Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, begun with Quicksilver and continued in The Confusion.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Neal Stephenson\The System of the World_ Volume Thr (628)\cover.jpg,9780060523879,2004-09-21T14:44:19+01:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"Scientists, General, Anne, Great Britain, Puritans, 1702-1714, Fiction - Historical, Counterfeiters, London (England), Kings and rulers, Fiction, Criminals, Newton, Historical, Suspense fiction, Isaac, Succession, American Historical Fiction, History, Historical - General, Crimes against",The System of the World: Volume Three of the Baroque Cycle,628

Neal Stephenson,"With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Naomi Klein,"WINNER 2014 – Hilary Weston Writers’ Trust Prize for Non-FictionForget everything you think you know about global warming. The really inconvenient truth is that it’s not about carbon—it’s about capitalism. The convenient truth is that we can seize this existential crisis to transform our failed system and build something radically better. In her most provocative book yet, Naomi Klein, author of the global bestsellers The Shock Doctrine and No Logo, tackles the most profound threat humanity has ever faced: the war our economic model is waging against life on earth.  Klein exposes the myths that are clouding the climate debate. We have been told the market will save us, when in fact the addiction to profit and growth is digging us in deeper every day. We have been told it’s impossible to get off fossil fuels when in fact we know exactly how to do it—it just requires breaking every rule in the “free-market” playbook: reining in corporate power, rebuilding local economies and reclaiming our democracies. We have also been told that humanity is too greedy and selfish to rise to this challenge. In fact, all around the world, the fight back is already succeeding in ways both surprising and inspiring.Climate change, Klein argues, is a civilizational wake-up call, a powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms and droughts. Confronting it is no longer about changing the light bulbs. It’s about changing the world—before the world changes so drastically that no one is safe. Either we leap—or we sink. Once a decade, Naomi Klein writes a book that redefines its era. No Logo did so for globalization. The Shock Doctrine changed the way we think about austerity.

Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life.

Michio Kaku,"A fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible—from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks—revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future.One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future. From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build oneKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it.

BY MICHELLE WEST
The Sword must be drawn….
The armies of Alesso di’Marente and Valedan kai di’Leonne are massing in the Terrean of Averda for the battle that will at last determine the rule of the Dominion. The Sun Sword is about to be delivered by Serra Diora to its “rightful” holder, Valedan, last surviving heir of the clan Leonne. But whether Valedan will be able to wield the sword, or — like the form kai el’Sol — will be consumed by its magic, remains to be seen.
The demon kin are gath­ering as well, and a dread spell is being worked which will — should it success­fully reach completion — finally open the way for the Lord of Night to once again enter the mortal realm.
And though many of the truly powerful have gathered upon the field, the entire course of the future may rest in the hands, heart and soul of one being, Kiriel di’Ashaf, daughter of the Lord of Night….

Michael Pollan,"The bestselling author of The Botany of Desire explores the ecology of eating to unveil why we consume what we consume in the twenty-first century  ""What should we have for dinner?"" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't-which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America.  Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or ""organic"" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal--at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary ""beyond organic"" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance.  We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Michael Pollan\The Omnivore's Dilemma_ A Natural H (648)\cover.jpg,9781594200823,2006-02-15T13:43:04+00:00,Penguin Group,,,1.0,"Food Science, General, Customs & Traditions, Life Sciences, Popular Culture, Evolution, Agriculture, Technology & Engineering, Popular Culture - General, Food preferences, Anthropology, Food habits, Nutrition, Ecology, Anthropology - General, Sociology, Medical, History, Science, Archaeology, Cooking, Manners And Customs, Diet & Nutrition, Social Science, Life Sciences - Ecology, Health & Fitness",The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,648
Michael Pollan,"An Idaho farmer cultivates Russet Burbank potatoes so that a customer at a McDonald's half a world away can enjoy a long, golden French fry. A gardener plants tulip bulbs in the fall and, come spring, has a riotous patch of color to admire. Two straightforward examples of how humans act on nature to get what we want. Or are they? What if those potatoes and tulips have evolved to gratify certain human desires so that humans will help them multiply? What if, in other words, these plants are using us just as we use them? Every schoolchild learns about the mutually beneficial dance of honeybees and flowers: The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and in the process spreads the flowers' genes far and wide. What Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates in The Botany of Desire is that people and domesticated plant species have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship, a relationship that is just as common and essential to the way nature works. In this utterly original narrative that blends history, memoir, and the best science writing, Pollan tells the story of four domesticated species-the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato-from the point of view of the plants. All four species are deeply woven into the fabric of our everyday lives, and Pollan illustrates how each has evolved a survival strategy based on satisfying one of humankind's most basic desires. The apple gratifies our taste for sweetness; the tulip attracts us with its beauty; marijuana offers intoxication; and the genetically modified potato gives us a sense of control over nature. And just as we've benefited from these plants, the plants, in the grand coevolutionary scheme that Pollan so brilliantly evokes, have done remarkably well by us. Take the apple, for example. In nineteenth-century America, frontier dwellers far from the trading posts of the East lacked a source of sweetness in their diet-and sugar with which to make alcohol. So when a man named John Chapman (a.k.a. Johnny Appleseed) floated down the Ohio River with bushels of apple seeds in his canoe, the settlers seized on the opportunity to grow the fruit on their new land. The pioneers' desire for sweetness was satisfied-and the apple was given a whole new continent on which to blossom. So who is really domesticating whom? Weaving fascinating anecdote and accessible science in gorgeous prose, Pollan takes the reader on an absorbing journey through the landscape of botany and desire. It is a journey that will change the way we think about our place in nature. In 1637, one Dutchman paid as much for a single tulip bulb as the going price of a town house in Amsterdam. Three & a half centuries later, Amsterdam is once again the mecca for people who care passionately about one particular plant-though this time the obsession revolves around the intoxicating effects of marijuana rather than the visual beauty of the tulip. How could flowers, of all things, become such objects of desire that they drive men to financial ruin? In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan argues that the answer lies at the heart of the intimately reciprocal relationship between people & plants. In telling the stories of four familiar plant species that are deeply woven into the fabric of our lives, Pollan illustrates how they evolved to satisfy humankind's most basic yearnings- & by doing so made themselves indispensable. For, just as we've benefited from these plants, the plants, in the grand co-evolutionary scheme that Pollan evokes so brilliantly, have done well by us. The sweetness of apples, for example, induced the early Americans to spread the species, giving the tree a whole new continent in which to blossom. So who is really domesticating whom?

Michael Pollan,"""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" These simple words go to the heart of food journalist Pollan's thesis. Humans used to know how to eat well, he argues, but the balanced dietary lessons that were once passed down through generations have been confused and distorted by food industry marketers, nutritional scientists, and journalists. As a result, we face today a complex culinary landscape dense with bad advice and foods that are not ""real."" Indeed, plain old eating is being replaced by an obsession with nutrition that is, paradoxically, ruining our health, not to mention our meals. Pollan's advice is: ""Don't eat anything that your great-great grandmother would not recognize as food."" Looking at what science does and does not know about diet and health, he proposes a new way to think about what to eat, informed by ecology and tradition rather than by the nutrient-by-nutrient approach.--From publisher description.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Michael Pollan\In Defense of Food_ An Eater's Mani (650)\cover.jpg,9781410405371,2008-02-15T12:57:43+00:00,Thorndike Press,,,1.0,"Large type books, Diet, Fitness, Food habits, Nutrition, Medical, Diet & Nutrition, Health, Health & Fitness",In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto,650

Michael J. Fox,"There are many words to describe Michael J. Fox: Actor. Husband. Father. Activist. But readers of Always Looking Up will soon add another to the list: Optimist. Michael writes about the hard-won perspective that helped him see challenges as opportunities. Instead of building walls around himself, he developed a personal policy of engagement and discovery: an emotional, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual outlook that has served him throughout his struggle with Parkinson's disease. Michael's exit from a very demanding, very public arena offered him the time-and the inspiration-to open up new doors leading to unexpected places. One door even led him to the center of his own family, the greatest destination of all. The last ten years, which is really the stuff of this book, began with such a loss: my retirement from Spin City. I found myself struggling with a strange new dynamic: the shifting of public and private personas. I had been Mike the actor, then Mike the actor with PD. Now was I just Mike with PD Parkinson's had consumed my career and, in a sense, had become my career. But where did all of this leave Me? I had to build a new life when I was already pretty happy with the old one.. Always Looking Up is a memoir of this last decade, told through the critical themes of Michael's life: work, politics, faith, and family. The book is a journey of self-discovery and reinvention, and a testament to the consolations that protect him from the ravages of Parkinson's. With the humor and wit that captivated fans of his first book, Lucky Man, Michael describes how he became a happier, more satisfied person by recognizing the gifts of everyday life.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Michael J.

Michael Connelly,"This enhanced ebook exclusively features: location photos, surveillance video, courtroom video, author video, family tree, timelines, author Q&A, maps and text-based links. Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch together take on a seemingly unwinnable case in Michael Connelly's latest blistering bestseller. When Mickey Haller is invited by the Los Angeles County District Attorney to prosecute a case for him, he knows something strange is going on. Mickey's a defense lawyer, one of the best in the business, and to switch sides like this would be akin to asking a fox to guard the hen-house. But the high-profile case of Jason Jessup, a convicted child-killer who spent almost 25 years on death row before DNA evidence freed him, is an intriguing one - particularly since the DA's determination to re-charge and re-try him for the same crime seems doomed to failure. Eager for the publicity and drawn to the challenge, Mickey takes the case, with Detective Harry Bosch on board as his lead investigator. But as a new trial date is set, it starts to look like he's been set up, with the renewed prosecution merely a tactic to prevent Jessup from successfully suing the state and county for millions of dollars. To avoid humiliation, Mickey and Harry are going to have to dig deep into the past and find the truth about Melissa Landy and what really happened to her all those years ago.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Michael Connelly\The Reversal (Kindle Enhanced Editi (671)\cover.jpg,9781409114413,2010-10-14T14:43:38+01:00,Orion,,,1.0,"FIC031000, Fiction, Crime, General, Police Procedural, Mystery & Detective",The Reversal (Kindle Enhanced Edition),671

Max Brooks,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - ""Prepare to be entranced by this addictively readable oral history of the great war between humans and zombies.""--Entertainment Weekly We survived the zombie apocalypse, but how many of us are still haunted by that terrible time? We have (temporarily?) defeated the living dead, but at what cost? Told in the haunting and riveting voices of the men and women who witnessed the horror firsthand, World War Z is the only record of the apocalyptic years. The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.

Matt Taibbi,"A REVELATORY AND DARKLY COMIC ADVENTURE THROUGH A NATION ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN—FROM THE HALLS OF CONGRESS TO THE BASES OF BAGHDAD TO THE APOCALYPTIC CHURCHES OF THE HEARTLANDRolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi set out to describe the nature of George Bush’s America in the post-9/11 era and ended up vomiting demons in an evangelical church in Texas, riding the streets of Baghdad in an American convoy to nowhere, searching for phantom fighter jets in Congress, and falling into the rabbit hole of the 9/11 Truth Movement.Matt discovered in his travels across the country that the resilient blue state/red state narrative of American politics had become irrelevant. A large and growing chunk of the American population was so turned off—or radicalized—by electoral chicanery, a spineless news media, and the increasingly blatant lies from our leaders (“they hate us for our freedom”) that they abandoned the political mainstream altogether. They joined what he calls The Great Derangement.Taibbi tells the story of this new American madness by inserting himself into four defining American subcultures: The Military, where he finds himself mired in the grotesque black comedy of the American occupation of Iraq; The System, where he follows the money-slicked path of legislation in Congress; The Resistance, where he doubles as chief public antagonist and undercover member of the passionately bonkers 9/11 Truth Movement; and The Church, where he infiltrates a politically influential apocalyptic mega-ministry in Texas and enters the lives of its desperate congregants. Together these four interwoven adventures paint a portrait of a nation dangerously out of touch with reality and desperately searching for answers in all the wrong places.Funny, smart, and a little bit heartbreaking, The Great Derangement is an audaciously reported, sobering, and illuminating portrait of America at the end of the Bush era.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Matt Taibbi\The Great Derangement_ A Terrifying (702)\cover.jpg,9780385525701,2008-05-06T14:40:40+01:00,Random House Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Political Science, Commentary & Opinion, Corruption & Misconduct, History, United States, 21st Century","The Great Derangement: A Terrifying True Story of War, Politics, and Religion at the Twilight of the American Empire",702

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,"Frankenstein was Mary Shelley's immensely powerful contribution to the ghost stories which she, Percy Shelley, and Byron wrote one wet summer in Switzerland. Its protagonist is a young student of natural philosophy, who learns the secret of imparting life to a creature constructed from relics of the dead, with horrific consequences. Frankenstein confronts some of the most feared innovations of evolutionism: topics such as degeneracy, hereditary disease, and mankind's status as a species of animal. The text used here is from the 1818 edition, which is a mocking exposé of leaders and achievers who leave desolation in their wake, showing mankind its choice - to live cooperatively or to die of selfishness. It is also a black comedy, and harder and wittier than the 1831 version with which we are more familiar. Drawing on new research, Marilyn Butler examines the novel in the context of the radical sciences, which were developing among much controversy in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, and shows how Frankenstein's experiment relates to a contemporary debate between the champions of materialist science and of received religion.

Mary Roach,"Stiff is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers—some willingly, some unwittingly—have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They've tested France's first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender reassignment surgery, cadavers have been there alongside surgeons, making history in their quiet way.In this fascinating, ennobling account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries—from the anatomy labs and human-sourced pharmacies of medieval and nineteenth-century Europe to a human decay research facility in Tennessee, to a plastic surgery practice lab, to a Scandinavian funeral directors' conference on human composting.

A timeless tale of switched identities, Twain''s story revolves around the miserably poor Tom Canty ""of Offal Court,"" who is lucky enough to trade his rags for the gilded robes of England''s prince, Edward Tudor.

Mark Twain,"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry ""Huck"" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about twenty years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. Perennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. It was criticized upon release because of its coarse language and became even more controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial stereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur ""nigger"", despite strong arguments that the protagonist, and the tenor of the book, is anti-racist.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Mark Twain\The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (711)\cover.jpg,9783730988923,2014-03-13T12:13:52+00:00,BookRix,,,1.0,"Literature - Classics, Fiction, Criticism, Political, Huckleberry (Fictitious character), General, Classics, Political fiction, Literary, Finn, Language Arts & Disciplines, Mississippi River",The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Illustrated),711

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. One of the greatest satires in American literature, Mark Twain''s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur''s Court begins when Hank Morgan, a skilled mechanic in a nineteenth-century New England arms factory, is struck on the head during a quarrel and awakens to find himself among the knights and magicians of King Arthur''s Camelot.What follows is a culture clash of the first magnitude, as practical-minded Hank, disgusted with the ignorance and superstition of the people, decides to enlighten them with education and technology. Through a series of wonderfully imaginative adventures, Twain celebrates American homespun ingenuity and democracy as compared to the backward ineptitude of a chivalric monarchy. At the same time, however, Twain raises the question of whether material progress necessarily creates a better society. As Hank becomes more powerful and self-righteous, he also becomes more ruthless, more autocratic, and less able to control events, until the only way out is a massively destructive war.While the dark pessimism that would fully blossom in Twain''s later works can be discerned in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur''s Court, the novel will nevertheless be remembered primarily for its wild leaps of imagination, brilliant wit, and entertaining storytelling.With over 200 of the original illustrations by Dan Beard.

Mark Bowden,"Already a classic of war reporting and now reissued as a Grove Press paperback, Black Hawk Down is Mark Bowden’s brilliant account of the longest sustained firefight involving American troops since the Vietnam War. On October 3, 1993, about a hundred elite U.S. soldiers were dropped by helicopter into the teeming market in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take an hour. Instead, they found themselves pinned down through a long and terrible night fighting against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. The following morning, eighteen Americans were dead and more than seventy had been badly wounded.Drawing on interviews from both sides, army records, audiotapes, and videos (some of the material is still classified), Bowden’s minute-by-minute narrative is one of the most exciting accounts of modern combat ever written—a riveting story that captures the heroism, courage, and brutality of battle.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Mark Bowden\Black Hawk Down_ A Story of Modern (714)\cover.jpg,9781555846046,2010-04-01T13:20:02+01:00,"Grove/Atlantic, Inc.",,,1.0,"Operation Restore Hope, Military - Strategy, General, United States., Africa, Military - Other, Other, 1934-, Central, Africa - Central, United States - History, Task Force Ranger, Military - United States, East, Strategy, War, Aidid, History, Army., 1992-1993, History - Military, United States, Military, Mohammed Farah, Africa - General",Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War,714

Malcolm X,"ONE OF TIME'S TEN MOST IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOKS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY   With its first great victory in the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the civil rights movement gained the powerful momentum it needed to sweep forward into its crucial decade, the 1960s. As voices of protest and change rose above the din of history and false promises, one voice sounded more urgently, more passionately, than the rest. Malcolm X--once called the most dangerous man in America--challenged the world to listen and learn the truth as he experienced it. And his enduring message is as relevant today as when he first delivered it.   In the searing pages of this classic autobiography, originally published in 1964, Malcolm X, the Muslim leader, firebrand, and anti-integrationist, tells the extraordinary story of his life and the growth of the Black Muslim movement to veteran writer and journalist Alex Haley . In a unique collaboration, Haley worked with Malcolm X for nearly two years, interviewing, listening to, and understanding the most controversial leader of his time.   Raised in Lansing, Michigan, Malcolm Little journeyed on a road to fame as astonishing as it was unpredictable. Drifting from childhood poverty to petty crime, Malcolm found himself in jail. It was there that he came into contact with the teachings of a little-known Black Muslim leader renamed Elijah Muhammad. The newly renamed Malcolm X devoted himself body and soul to the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and the world of Islam, becoming the Nation's foremost spokesman. When his conscience forced him to break with Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity to reach African Americans across the country with an inspiring message of pride, power, and self-determination.   The Autobiography of Malcolm X defines American culture and the African American struggle for social and economic equality that has now become a battle for survival. Malcolm's fascinating perspective on the lies and limitations of the American Dream, and the inherent racism in a society that denies its nonwhite citizens the opportunity to dream, gives extraordinary insight into the most urgent issues of our own time.   The Autobiography of Malcolm X stands as the definitive statement of a movement and a man whose work was never completed but whose message is timeless. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand America.   Praise for The Autobiography of Malcolm X   ""Malcolm X's autobiography seemed to offer something different. His repeated acts of self-creation spoke to me; the blunt poetry of his words, his unadorned insistence on respect, promised a new and uncompromising order, martial in its discipline, forged through sheer force of will.""--Barack Obama, Dreams from My Father  ""Extraordinary . . . a brilliant, painful, important book.""--The New York Times   ""A great book . . . Its dead level honesty, its passion, its exalted purpose, will make it stand as a monument to the most painful truth.""--The Nation   ""The most important book I'll ever read, it changed the way I thought, it changed the way I acted. It has given me courage I didn't know I had inside me. I'm one of hundreds of thousands whose lives were changed for the better.""--Spike Lee   ""This book will have a permanent place in the literature of the Afro-American struggle.""--I. F.

Malcolm Gladwell,"The landmark book that has revolutionized the way we understand leadership and decision making -- from #1 bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell.In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within.Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Malcolm Gladwell\Blink_ The Power of Thinking Withou (733)\cover.jpg,9780316005043,2007-04-03T13:20:19+01:00,Hachette UK,,,1.0,"Decision making, Finance, Decision Making & Problem Solving, Psychology, Decision-Making & Problem Solving, SELF-HELP, Personal Growth, General, Communication & Social Skills, Cognitive Psychology, Intuition, Education, Business, Social Psychology, Business & Economics, Economics, Personal Growth - General",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,733

A high school math genius, he’s secretly fascinated with a series of children’s fantasy novels set in a magical land called Fillory, and real life is disappointing by comparison. When Quentin is unexpectedly admitted to an elite, secret college of magic, it looks like his wildest dreams may have come true.

Meanwhile, the magical barriers that keep Fillory safe are failing, and barbarians from the north have invaded. Eliot and Janet, the rulers of Fillory, embark on a final quest to save their beloved world, only to discover a situation far more complex—and far more dire—than anyone had envisioned.Along with Plum, a brilliant young magician with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters.

Now a group of one hundred colonists begins a mission whose ultimate goal is to transform Mars into a more Earthlike planet. They will place giant satellite mirrors in Martian orbit to reflect light to the surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth and melt the ice.

His son, born first, is perfectly healthy, but the doctor immediately recognizes that his daughter has Down syndrome. Rationalizing it as a need to protect Norah, his wife, he makes a split second decision that will alter all of their lives forever.

Ken Follett has 90 million readers worldwide. The Pillars of the Earth is his bestselling book of all time. Now, eighteen years after the publication of The Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follett has written the most-anticipated sequel of the year—World Without End. View our Ken Follett feature page. In 1989 Ken Follett astonished the literary world with The Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected. Critics were overwhelmed—“it will hold you, fascinate you, surround you” (Chicago Tribune)—and readers everywhere hoped for a sequel. World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroad of new ideas— about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race—the Black Death. Three years in the writing, and nearly eighteen years since its predecessor, World Without End breathes new life into the epic historical novel and once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ken Follett\World Without End (833)\cover.jpg,9780525950073,2007-02-15T13:54:16+00:00,Dutton,,,1.0,"Ken - Prose & Criticism, Black Death - England, Great Britain - History - 14th century, General, Thrillers, Follett, Great Britain, Suspense, England, Fiction - Historical, Fiction, Black death, Historical, English, 14th century, Romance, History, Historical - General, Historical fiction",World Without End,833

Ken Follett,"In his own bestselling tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, Ken Follett delivers a breathtaking novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of World War II. Look out for Ken's newest book, A Column of Fire, available now.  D-Day is approaching. They don't know where or when, but the Germans know it'll be soon, and for Felicity ""Flick"" Clariet, the stakes have never been higher. A senior agent in the ranks of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) responsible for sabotage, Flick has survived to become one of Britain's most effective operatives in Northern France. She knows that the Germans' ability to thwart the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe.  But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on assault that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down. Her group destroyed, her husband missing, her superiors unsure of her, her own confidence badly shaken, she has one last chance at the target, but the challenge, once daunting, is now near impossible. The new plan requires an all-woman team, none of them professionals, to be assembled and trained within days. Code-named the Jackdaws, they will attempt to infiltrate the exchange under the noses of the Germans--but the Germans are waiting for them now and have plans of their own. There are secrets Flick does not know--secrets within the German ranks, secrets among her hastily recruited team, secrets among those she trusts the most. And as the hours tick down to the point of no return, most daunting of all, there are secrets within herself. . . .

Ken Follett,"View our Ken Follett feature page.   Ken Follett's World Without End was a global phenomenon, a work of grand historical sweep, beloved by millions of readers and acclaimed by critics. Fall of Giants is his magnificent new historical epic. The first novel in The Century Trilogy, it follows the fates of five interrelated families—American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh—as they move through the world-shaking dramas of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the struggle for women's suffrage. Thirteen-year-old Billy Williams enters a man's world in the Welsh mining pits...Gus Dewar, an American law student rejected in love, finds a surprising new career in Woodrow Wilson's White House...two orphaned Russian brothers, Grigori and Lev Peshkov, embark on radically different paths half a world apart when their plan to emigrate to America falls afoul of war, conscription, and revolution...Billy's sister, Ethel, a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts, takes a fateful step above her station, while Lady Maud Fitzherbert herself crosses deep into forbidden territory when she falls in love with Walter von Ulrich, a spy at the German embassy in London... These characters and many others find their lives inextricably entangled as, in a saga of unfolding drama and intriguing complexity, Fall of Giants moves seamlessly from Washington to St. Petersburg, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the corridors of power to the bedrooms of the mighty. As always with Ken Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. It is destined to be a new classic.  In future volumes of The Century Trilogy, subsequent generations of the same families will travel through the great events of the rest of the twentieth century, changing themselves-and the century itself.

Kazuo Ishiguro,"From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.  Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.  Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.  Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society.

Kathryn Stockett,"Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.  Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.  Minny, Aibileen&#39;s best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody&#39;s business, but she can&#39;t mind her tongue, so she&#39;s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.  Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.  In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women-- mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends--view one another.

Kathy Griffin,"A Conversation with Kathy Griffin:Q: State your name and profession.KG: My name is Kathy Griffin, and I am a teller of d**k jokes. And a plumber.Q: This is your first book. Had you ever considered writing anything before? A novel? Or a work of historical scholarship? Or a children's story?KG: I had not considered it, because I'd always been told by the nuns at St. Bernadine's that my cursive was poor. A children' s story is an interesting idea. How's this for a title: ""Waterboarding Pre-Teens: The Debate is Back On."" I have a political side as well.Q: You seem fairly obsessed with Oprah. Is this something you'll ever outgrow?KG: I will never outgrow my obsession with Oprah. Just as she will never outgrow her cardigan sweaters. Oops, she already has. Now look, that sounds like a dig, but it's not. It's called a struggle, and I'm on it with her. I support her. (Not as much as she needs those underwire bras to support her, because she's got some serious ropes and pulleys going on there.) The point is, I worship her, and fear her at the same time. And believe me, that' s how she wants it. Don't be fooled.Q: Did I miss something? Where's Celine Dion in this book?KG: I didn't write about Celine Dion, only because of my fear of her husband Rene Angelil. I have an unfounded but constant fear that he could be in the French-Canadian mafia. Or have French-Canadian mafia ties, and by ties I don't mean les cravats. And I fear that I may be abducted, whisked away and held prisoner at a charming little brasserie in Montreal, forced to eat multiple Croque Monsieur sandwiches until I confess to knowing the lyrics to every single one of her songs.Q: What do you think gays should take away from reading this book?KG: I think the gays should be happy with this book. It talks a lot about being who you are, and I certainly mention a lot of gay people. I would say it definitely has strong gay themes, and the gay community should know that frankly it has been a moral struggle for me to even acknowledge the heterosexual community in this book at all. But I am slowly reaching out an olive branch to the heterosexual community, even though I believe everything they do goes against the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But I'm trying not to judge them.Q: Describe your ideal, make-a-wish day of personal experiences with bats**t celebrities.KG: Well, it would start with some sort of a fit in the hair-and-makeup trailer on a set. I heard a story that when Sharon Stone was working on ""Casino,"" she got into such a fight with her hairdresser, that after he spent four hours doing this beautiful bouffant hairdo for her, she got up and walked in the sink and put her head underwater. I have no idea if that's true, but I hope it is, cause that's some awesome s**t I would love to see. Then it would go right to lunch, where I could witness an eating disorder. Maybe a Lohan is purging in a bush somewhere with her finger down her throat. Or perhaps there's an Olsen twin on a scale crying because she finally tipped 100. Any outburst over weight I would cherish. Also, it would be great to see an actress have a workload meltdown. So maybe at 2:00 some A-lister saying, ""I can't handle this s**t anymore."" Because I love when actors can't deal with a normal workday, and they think two in the afternoon is like midnight, so I would love to see somebody storming to their car, exhausted because they've put in a grueling four-hour workday of saying three lines and texting their nanny. Then it's maybe off to an illicit affair. At the top of my wish list would be following a rapper or a football player over to his baby mama's house where a screaming match ensues to the point where someone, maybe me, has to anonymously dial 911, and then I take a couple pictures, and I become an unannounced star witness later at the trial, enterin",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Kathy Griffin\Official Book Club Selection_ A Mem (843)\cover.jpg,9780345518569,2010-02-15T13:16:53+00:00,Ballantine Books,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Biography, Women, Humor, Personal Memoirs, General, Actors, Entertainment & Performing Arts, United States, Comedians",Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin,843

Karen Armstrong,"""As soon as they became recognizably human, men and women--in their hunger to understand their own presence on earth and the mysteries within and around them--began to worship gods. Karen Armstrong's masterly and illuminating book explores the ways in which the idea and experience of God evolved among the monotheists--Jews, Christians and Muslims. Weaving a multicolored fabric of historical, philosophical, intellectual and social developments and insights, Armstrong shows how, at various times through the centuries, each of the monotheistic religions has held a subtly different concept of God. At the same time she draws our attention to the basic and profound similarities among them, making it clear that in all of them God has been and is experienced intensely, passionately and often--especially in the West--traumatically. Some monotheists have seen darkness, desolation and terror, where others have seen light and transfiguration; the reasons for these inherent differences are examined, and the people behind them are brought to life. We look first at the gradual move away from the pagan gods to the full-fledged monotheism of the Jews during the exile in Babylon. Next considered is the development of parallel, yet different, perceptions and beliefs among Christians and Muslims. The book then moves ""generationally"" through time to examine the God of the philosophers and mystics in all three traditions, the God of the Reformation, the God of the Enlightenment and finally the nineteenth- and twentieth-century challenges of skeptics and atheists, as well as the fiercely reductive faith of the fundamentalists of our own day. Armstrong suggests that any particular idea of God must--if it is to survive--work for the people who develop it, and that ideas of God change when they cease to be effective. She argues that the concept of a personal God who behaves like a larger version of ourselves was suited to mankind at a certain stage but no longer works for an increasing number of people."" ""Understanding the ever-changing ideas of God in the past and their relevance and usefulness in their time, she says, is a way to begin the search for a new concept for the twenty-first century. Her book shows that such a development is virtually inevitable, in spite of the despair of our increasingly ""Godless"" world, because it is a natural aspect of our humanity to seek a symbol for the ineffable reality that is universally perceived.""--Publisher's description.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Karen Armstrong\A History of God_ The 4000-Year Que (847)\cover.jpg,9780345384560,1994-02-15T12:54:01+00:00,Ballantine Books,,,1.0,"History of doctrines, God (Islam), Christian Rituals & Practice - General, General, Comparative Religion, Faith, Judaism, Biblical teaching, Islam - Doctrines - History, Religion - Commentaries, God (Islam) - History of doctrines, God - History of doctrines, Reference, God (Judaism) - History of doctrines, Religion, God - Biblical teaching, Judaism - Doctrines - History, History, God (Christianity), God (Judaism), god, Islam, Comparative studies, Christian Rituals & Practice","A History of God: The 4000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam",847
Kai-Fu Lee,"THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLERDr. Kai-Fu Lee—one of the world’s most respected experts on AI and China—reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace.   In AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of these unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected. Indeed, as the US-Sino AI competition begins to heat up, Lee urges the US and China to both accept and to embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power.

Jules Verne,"Originally serialized between March 1869 and June 1870, Jules Verne's ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" is one of the greatest underwater sea adventures of all time. It is the story of Professor Pierre Aronnax who sets off aboard an American frigate to investigate a series of attacks, which has been reported to be made by an amphibious monster.

Joshua Foer,"Foer's unlikely journey from chronically forgetful science journalist to U.S. Memory Champion frames a revelatory exploration of the vast, hidden impact of memory on every aspect of our lives.   On average, people squander forty days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories.  Moonwalking with Einstein draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top ""mental athletes,"" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories.  Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination-showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity.  Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City, he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx, he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam.  At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. Moonwalking with Einstein brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Joshua Foer\Moonwalking With Einstein_ The Art (860)\cover.jpg,9781594202292,2011-02-15T13:11:34+00:00,Penguin Press,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Neuroscience, Memory, Personal Growth, Psychology, SELF-HELP, Science, Personal Memoirs, Cognitive Psychology, Mnemonics, Life Sciences, Memory Improvement",Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,860
Joseph O'Neill,"In a New York City made phantasmagorical by the events of 9/11, Hans--a banker originally from the Netherlands--finds himself marooned among the strange occupants of the Chelsea Hotel after his English wife and son return to London. Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an “other” New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck’s particular brand of naivete and chutzpah--by his ability to a hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith.  Netherlandgives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider’s vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man--of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory.

Joseph Heller,"Fifty years after its original publication, ""Catch-22 ""remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest--and most celebrated--books of all time. In recent years it has been named to ""best novels"" lists by ""Time, Newsweek, ""the Modern Library, and the London ""Observer."" Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy--it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he's assigned, he'll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller's masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller's personal archive; and much more.

Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man-or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jonathan Franzen\The Corrections (869)\cover.jpg,9780312421274,2002-09-15T13:34:04+01:00,Picador,,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction",The Corrections,869
Jonathan Franzen,"Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?In his first novel since The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jonathan Franzen\Freedom_ A Novel (870)\cover.jpg,9781429979436,2010-08-31T13:48:36+01:00,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",,,1.0,"Fiction, Literary",Freedom: A Novel,870

Jon Krakauer,"Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. He now shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders, taking readers inside isolated American communities where some 40,000 Mormon Fundamentalists still practice polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God.  At the core of Krakauer’s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jon Krakauer\Under the Banner of Heaven_ A Story (872)\cover.jpg,9781400032808,2004-02-15T13:49:30+00:00,Anchor Books,,,1.0,"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon), Religion - Mormon, Fundamentalism, 20th century, United States - 20th Century (1945 to 2000), General, True Crime, Christianity - Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon), Journalism, Mormon fundamentalism, Language Arts & Disciplines, Religion, Murder, Christianity - Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (, Murder - General, LDS, Christianity - Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saomts (, History, Christianity, United States",Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,872

Johnny Cash,"He was the ""Man in Black,"" a country music legend, and the quintessential American troubadour. He was an icon of rugged individualism who had been to hell and back, telling the tale as never before. In his unforgettable autobiography, Johnny Cash tells the truth about the highs and lows, the struggles and hard-won triumphs, and the people who shaped him. In his own words, Cash set the record straight - and dispelled a few myths - as he looked unsparingly at his remarkable life: from the joys of his boyhood in Dyess, Arkansas to superstardom in Nashville, Tennessee, the road of Cash's life has been anything but smooth. Cash writes of the thrill of playing with Elvis, the comfort of praying with Billy Graham; of his battles with addiction and of the devotion of his wife, June; of his gratitude for life, and of his thoughts on what the afterlife may bring. Here, too, are the friends of a lifetime, including Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, and Kris Kristofferson. As powerful and memorable as one of his classic songs, *Cash* is filled with the candor, wit, and wisdom of a man who truly ""walked the line."" **

John Wyndham,"The Chrysalids is set in the future after a devastating global nuclear war. David, the young hero of the novel, lives in a tight-knit community of religious and genetic fundamentalists, who exist in a state of constant alert for any deviation from what they perceive as the norm of God's creation, deviations broadly classified as ""offenses"" and ""blasphemies."" Offenses consist of plants and animals that are in any way unusual, and these are publicly burned to the accompaniment of the singing of hymns. Blasphemies are human beings--ones who show any sign of abnormality, however trivial. They are banished from human society, cast out to live in the wild country where, as the authorities say, nothing is reliable and the devil does his work. David grows up surrounded by admonitions: KEEP PURE THE STOCK OF THE LORD; WATCH THOU FOR THE MUTANT. At first he hardly questions them, though he is shocked when his sternly pious father and rigidly compliant mother force his aunt to forsake her baby. It is a while before he realizes that he too is out of the ordinary, in possession of a power that could doom him to death or introduce him to a new, hitherto-unimagined world of freedom. The Chrysalids is a perfectly conceived and constructed work from the classic era of science fiction.

John Joseph Adams,"There is a sickness in the land. Prophets tell of the fall of empires, the rise of champions. Great beasts stir in vaults beneath the hills, beneath the waves. Armies mass. Gods walk. The world will be torn asunder.  Epic fantasy is storytelling at its biggest and best. From the creation myths and quest sagas of ancient times to the mega-popular fantasy novels of today, these are the stories that express our greatest hopes and fears, that create worlds so rich we long to return to them again and again, and that inspire us with their timeless values of courage and friendship in the face of ultimate evil--tales that transport us to the most ancient realms and show us the most noble sacrifices, the most astonishing wonders.  Now acclaimed editor John Joseph Adams (Wastelands, The Living Dead) brings you seventeen tales by today's leading authors of epic fantasy, including George R. R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire), Ursula K. Le Guin (Earthsea), Robin Hobb (Realms of Elderlings), Kate Elliott (Crown of Stars), Tad Williams (Of Memory, Sorrow & Thorn), Patrick Rothfuss (The Kingkiller Chronicle), and more.

John Irving,"In 1954, in the cookhouse of a logging and sawmill settlement in northern New Hampshire, an anxious twelve-year-old boy mistakes the local constable's girlfriend for a bear. Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County - to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto - pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.In a story spanning five decades, Last Night in Twisted River - John Irving's twelfth novel - depicts the recent half-century in the United States as 'a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course'. From the novel's taut opening sentence - 'The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long' - to its elegiac final chapter, Last Night in Twisted River is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of The Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meany. It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving's breakthrough bestseller, The World According to Garp. What further distinguishes Last Night in Twisted River is the author's unmistakable voice - the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: 'We don't always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly - as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth - the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives'.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\John Irving\Last Night in Twisted River (895)\cover.jpg,9781408806098,2009-10-19T14:02:40+01:00,Bloomsbury,,,1.0,"Fiction, General",Last Night in Twisted River,895

John Grisham,"Rick Dockery was the third-string quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. In the AFC Championship game, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstock—and was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams. But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds, Rick finally gets a job—as the starting quarterback for the Mighty Panthers . . . of Parma, Italy. The Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player—any former NFL player—at their helm. And now they’ve got Rick, who knows nothing about Parma (not even where it is) and doesn’t speak a word of Italian. To say that Italy—the land of fine wines, extremely small cars, and football americano—holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement. . . .",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\John Grisham\Playing for Pizza (917)\cover.jpg,9780440244714,2008-02-15T13:21:29+00:00,DELL,,,1.0,"Fiction, Sports, Americans, General, Parma (Italy) - Social life and customs, Popular American Fiction, Americans - Italy - Parma, Fiction - General, Suspense, Parma (Italy), Quarterbacks (Football)",Playing for Pizza,917

John Bingham,"FROM THE INTRODUCTION BY JOHN LE CARRÉ   ""This novel comprises some of the best work of an extremely gifted and perhaps under-regarded British crime novelist.... What gave John Bingham his magic was something we look for in every writer, too often in vain: an absolute command of the internal landscape of his characters, acutely observed by a humane but wonderfully corrosive eye."" ""On a recuperative trip in Italy after a car accident, reporter and novelist James Compton is witness to the discovery of a murder victim, a woman who had been vacationing at the same hotel. Lucy Dawson seemed like a gentle old lady, and so the motive for her death appeared to be unmeditated assault. But when he returns to England and makes a benign inquiry into her background, Compton receives a note warning him to leave the past alone -- a note clearly written on his own typewriter, though his apartment shows no sign of a break-in.   Unable to resist pursuing the unfinished story, Compton's own investigation reveals a sinister side to Lucy Dawson and a cold-blooded conspiracy she may have helped to perpetrate while alive. Suddenly Compton finds a dangerous net closing in around him: threatening phone calls, terrifying invasions of privacy, and no way of proving to the police that anyone is responsible but himself.   In the tradition of Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith, John Bingham's writing has earned him a place amongst the great suspense writers of the twentieth century.

In In Her Shoes, Rose and Maggie Feller learned about family secrets and the ties that bind. Now, in Jennifer Weiner's richest, wittiest, most true-to-life novel yet, this highly acclaimed storyteller brings readers a tale of romance, friendship, forgiveness, and extreme sleep deprivation, as three very different women navigate one of life's most wonderful and perilous transitions: the journey of new motherhood.  Rebecca Rothstein-Rabinowitz is a plump, sexy chef who has a wonderful husband, supportive friends, a restaurant that's received citywide acclaim, a beautiful baby girl...and the mother-in-law from hell.  Kelly Day's life looks picture-perfect. But behind the doors of her largely empty apartment, she's struggling to balance work and motherhood and marriage, while entering Oliver's every move (and movement) on a spreadsheet, and dealing with an unemployed husband who seems content to channel-surf for eight hours a day.  And Ayinde Towne is already on shaky ground, trying to live her life to the letter of a how-to guide called Baby Success, when her basketball superstar husband breaks her trust at the most vulnerable moment in her life, putting their marriage in peril -- and their new family even more in the public eye.  Then there's Lia Frederick, a Philadelphia native who has just come home, leaving Los Angeles behind, along with her glamorous Hollywood career, her husband, and a tragic secret, to start her life all over again.

Jeff Sharlet,"A journalist's penetrating and controversial look at the untold story of Christian fundamentalism's most elite organisation- a self-described 'invisible' global network dedicated to a religion of power for the powerful. They are 'the Family' - fundamentalism's avant-garde, waging spiritual war in the halls of American power and around the globe. They consider themselves the 'new chosen'- congressmen, generals and foreign dictators who meet in confidential 'cells', to pray and plan for a 'leadership led by God', to be won not by force but through 'quiet diplomacy'. Jeff Sharlet is the only journalist to have reported from inside its walls. The Family is about the other half of American fundamentalist power - not its angry masses, but its sophisticated elites. In public, they host Prayer Breakfasts; in private they preach a gospel of 'biblical capitalism', military might and American empire. Citing Hitler, Lenin and Mao as leadership models, the Family's current leader, Doug Coe, declares, 'We work with power where we can, build new power where we can't'. Part history, part investigative journalism, The Family is a compelling account of how fundamentalism came to be interwoven with American power and the no-holds-barred economics of globalisation. No other book about the Right has exposed the Family or revealed its far-reaching impact on democracy, and no future reckoning of fundamentalism will be able to ignore it.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jeff Sharlet\The Family_ Power, Politics and Fun (962)\cover.jpg",9780702236945,2008-02-15T12:44:56+00:00,Univ. of Queensland Press,,,1.0,,"The Family: Power, Politics and Fundamentalism's Shadow Elite",962

Jeannette Walls,"Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.

Now she brings us the story of her grandmother -- told in a voice so authentic and compelling that the book is destined to become an instant classic.""Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did."" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, in Jeannette Walls's magnificent, true-life novel based on her no-nonsense, resourceful, hard working, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, all alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (""I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place"") and fly a plane, and, with her husband, ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle.  Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold.

Jean M. Auel,"The Shelters of Stone opens as Ayla and Jondalar, along with their animal friends, Wolf, Whinney, and Racer, complete their epic journey across Europe and are greeted by Jondalar’s people: the Zelandonii. The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes—formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone—are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave (and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills. But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla’s unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan. Some even oppose her mating with Jondalar, and make their displeasure known. Ayla has to call on all her skills, intelligence, knowledge, and instincts to find her way in this complicated society, to prepare for the birth of her child, and to decide whether she will accept new challenges and play a significant role in the destiny of the Zelandonii. Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of a prehistoric society.

Jean M. Auel,"Set in the challenging terrain of Ice Age Europe that millions of Jean Auel’s readers have come to treasure, The Mammoth Hunters is an epic novel of love, knowledge, jealousy, and hard choices—a novel certain to garner Jean Auel even greater acclaim as a master storyteller of the dawn of humanity.Ayla, the independent heroine of The Clan of the Cave Bear and The Valley of Horses, sets out from the valley on Whinney, the horse she tamed. With her is Jondalar, the tall, handsome, yellow-haired man she nursed back to health and came to love. Together they meet the Mamutoi—the Mammoth Hunters—people like Ayla. But to Ayla, who was raised by the Clan of the Cave Bear, they are “the Others.” She approaches them with mixed feelings of fear and curiosity. Talut, a powerful bear of a man with bright red hair, a booming laugh, and a gentle heart, and his tall, dark-haired sister, Tulie, are the leaders of the Lion Camp of the Mamutoi. It is here that Ayla finds her first women friends, but some among the Mamutoi dislike Ayla because she was raised by “flatheads,” their name for the people of the Clan. Ayla is haunted by her memories of the Clan because Rydag, a child of mixed parentage living with the Mamutoi, bears so strong a resemblance to her own son, Durc. It is the Mamutoi master carver of ivory—dark-skinned Ranec, flirtatious, artistic, magnetic—who fascinates Ayla. She finds herself drawn to him. Because of her uncanny control over animals, her healing skills, and the magic firestone she discovered, Ayla is adopted into the Mammoth Hearth by Mamut, the ancient shaman of the Great Earth Mother. Ayla finds herself torn between her strong feelings for Ranec and her powerful love for the wildly jealous and unsure Jondalar.

Its harsh but spectacularly beautiful terrain supports many varieties of animals but few people. They are Cro-Magnons - the first anatomically modern people - and Neanderthals, the other race with whom we shared that cold, ancient land. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon child who lost her parents in an earthquake and was adopted by a tribe of Neanderthal, the Clan. The Clan's wary suspicion was gradually transformed into acceptance of this girl, so different from them, under the guidance of its medicine woman Iza and its wise holy man Creb. But Broud, the Clan's future leader, becomes an implacable enemy, and causes her exile. Forced into dangerous isolation, she eventually finds her soul mate and fellow Cro-Magnon, Jondalar.

Jared M. Diamond & Professor Of Geography Jared Diamond,"A global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race. Until around 11,000 b.c., all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide. The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren't native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences. He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, Guns, Germs and Steel encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jared M.

Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey. According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He’s chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he’s chosen the Barrens as his new playground. Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He’s now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn’t made it out of the boys’ department at Macy’s. Anyone who says good things come in small packages hasn’t met Munch. Wulf Grimoire is looking for world domination. Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey. She also gets a big guy named Diesel. Diesel pops in and out of Plum’s life like birthday cake – delicious to look at and taste, not especially healthy as a steady diet, gone by the end of the week if not sooner.

And if truth were told, he wouldn’t mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs.

And there's an angry little man (don't call him a dwarf!) who won't leave her apartment. Bail jumping in Trenton is down to small potatoes.

Janet Evanovich,"#1 New York Times#1 Wall Street Journal#1 Los Angeles Times#1 Entertainment Weekly#1 Publishers WeeklyStephanie Plum is thinking her career as a fugitive apprehension agent has run its course. She's been shot at, spat at, cussed at, fire-bombed, mooned, and attacked by dogs. Time for a change, Stephanie thinks. Time to find the kind of job her mother can tell her friends about without making the sign of the cross. So Stephanie Plum quits. Resigns. No looking back. No changing her mind. She wants something safe and normal. As it turns out, jobs that are safe and normal for most people aren't necessarily safe and normal for Stephanie Plum. Trouble follows her, and the kind of trouble she had at the bail bonds office can't compare to the kind of trouble she finds herself facing now. Her past has come back to haunt her. She's stalked by a maniac returned from the grave for the sole purpose of putting her into a burial plot of her own. He's killed before, and he'll kill again if given the chance. Caught between staying far away from the bounty hunter business and staying alive, Stephanie reexamines her life and the possibility that being a bounty hunter is the solution rather than the problem. After disturbingly brief careers at the button factory, Kan Klean Dry Cleaners, and Cluck-in-a-Bucket, Stephanie takes an office position in security, working for Ranger, the sexiest, baddest bounty hunter and businessman on two continents. It might not be the job she'll keep for the rest of her life, but for now it gives her the technical access she needs to find her stalker. Tempers and temperatures rise as competition ratchets up between the two men in her life---her on-again, off-again boyfriend, tough Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and her bad-ass boss, Ranger. Can Stephanie Plum take the heat? Can you?Between the adventure and the adversity there's attitude, and Stephanie Plum's got plenty in her newest misadventure from Janet Evanovich, Eleven on Top.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Janet Evanovich\Eleven on Top (998)\cover.jpg,9781429971171,2010-04-01T13:41:11+01:00,St. Martin's Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Women Sleuths, Fiction, Romantic Comedy, General, Mystery & Detective, Humorous, Romance",Eleven on Top,998

Jane Austen,"Jane Austen’s first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, is a witty satire of the sentimental novel, a popular genre in Britain throughout the 1790s and the Regency. When it first appeared in 1811, the words in its title carried significant cultural weight beyond the confines of the novel, and into both popular and learned discourse. Through her dual heroines, Austen addresses, and satirizes, notions of sense and sensibility, and engages with the issues of inheritance, marriage, and love.   The story concerns two sisters: the level-headed Elinor and the passionate and impulsive Marianne. When their father dies, his son by a previous marriage assumes possession of the family home. Marianne and Elinor, left to the care of their mercenary brother John and his wife Fanny, must remove to a cottage with their mother. Each sister meets a man in whom she is interested, and as with other Austen novels, requited love does not come easily.   This newly annotated edition offers a thorough and perceptive introduction and a wide range of carefully selected contextual materials that further explore the term “sensibility.”",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jane Austen\Sense and Sensibility (1000)\cover.jpg,9781551111254,2001-04-03T14:30:36+01:00,Broadview Press,,,1.0,"General, Drama, Scottish, Domestic drama, England, Family, Irish, Sisters, Welsh, Juvenile Fiction, Literary Criticism, Fiction, American, Man-woman relationships, Inheritance and succession, Social classes, English, Siblings, Literary, European, Social Science, Young women",Sense and Sensibility,1000

Anne Elliot is persuaded by her friends and family to reject a marriage proposal from Captain Wentworth because he lacks in fortune and rank. More than seven years later, when he returns home from the Navy, Anne realises she still has strong feelings for him, but Wentworth only appears to have eyes for a friend of Anne’s.

First published over fifteen years ago and long out-of-print, the poster and accompanying paperback book sum up the mis-tellingsand reveal the real storyin a graphically appealing and accessible format.In vintage Loewen fashion, the poster juxtaposes short quotes from a range of high school textbooks currently in use today, with excerpts from primary sources that clearly show how textbooks have ""lied"" by knowingly substituting crowd-pleasing myths for grim and gruesome historical evidence.In fact, these textbooks intentionally omitted every important detail that we do know about Columbus's fateful voyage to the Americas. Among countless other facts, Loewen demonstrates that Columbus and his men were far from the first to set foot in the ""New World,"" and that the peoples he encountered there did not submit to the ""god-like"" authority of him and his crewmen, but rather to the deadly forms of smallpox and bubonic plague they brought with them from Europe.In concise, deeply engaging prose, Loewen expands on these little-discussed facts, putting them in the larger context of a discussion of ""truth"" and revisionist history.

James Joyce,"One of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, Ulysses has had a profound influence on modern fiction. In a series of episodes covering the course of a single day, June 16, 1904, the novel traces the movements of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus through the streets of Dublin. Each chapter has its own remarkably innovative literary style, and the book is one of the great, extended tours de force of stream-of-consciousness narration. It is an essential stop in any tour of English literature.  This marvelous edition reproduces in facsimile the original 1922 text. Today critical interest centers on the authority of the text, and this edition republishes for the first time, without interference, the original 1922 text. Equally important, Jeri Johnson's editorial material is acknowledged to be by far the best there is. Her textual apparatus--notes, introduction, stemma of published versions--is unsurpassed. Johnson strikes the perfect balance between what readers need to know in her notes and introduction. Her fantastic explanatory notes begin by giving the time and location of each episode and a description of the correspondence with the episode in Homer being paralleled. In addition, the introduction is a model of scholarship and lucidity, leading the first-time reader through the intricacies of the text.  This edition also includes a full list of errata, a Composition and Publication History, an up-to-date bibliography, a chronology of Joyce's lie, a map of Dublin of the period, appendices reproducing Gilbert and Linati schema (i.e. the tables that set out the symbolic significance of each episode in the novel by title, hour of the day, place of the action), and much more. It is the perfect introduction to the crowning work of modernist literature.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\James Joyce\Ulysses (1037)\cover.jpg,9780199535675,2008-04-17T14:49:00+01:00,OUP Oxford,,,1.0,"Literary Criticism, Fiction, General, Classics, Literary, Fiction : General, Fiction - General, Fiction : Literary",Ulysses,1037

Its originality shocked contemporary readers on its publication in 1916 who found its treating of the minutiae of daily life indecorous, and its central character unappealing. Was it art orwas it filth? The novel charts the intellectual, moral, and sexual development of Stephen Dedalus, from his childhood listening to his father's stories through his schooldays and adolescence to the brink of adulthood and independence, and his awakening as an artist. Growing up in a Catholic family in Dublin in the final years of the nineteenth century, Stephen's consciousness is forged by Irish history and politics, by Catholicism and culture, language and art. Stephen's story mirrors that of Joyce himself, and the novel is both startlingly realistic and brilliantly crafted. For this edition Jeri Johnson, editor of the acclaimed Ulysses 1922 text, has written an introduction and notes which together provide a comprehensive and illuminating appreciation of Joyce's artistry.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\James Joyce\A Portrait of the Artist as a Young (1038)\cover.jpg,9780192839985,2000-02-15T13:22:30+00:00,Oxford University Press,,,1.0,"Literary, Unknown, Fiction, Classics",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,1038
James Joyce,"Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories by James Joyce, first published in 1914. The fifteen stories were meant to be a naturalistic depiction of the Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century. The stories were written at the time when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by various converging ideas and influences. They center on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment where a character has a special moment of self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by children as protagonists, and as the stories continue, they deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This is in line with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\James Joyce\Dubliners (1039)\cover.jpg,9782322237159,2020-07-08T13:40:01+01:00,BoD - Books on Demand,,,1.0,"Fiction, Historical, General, Classics",Dubliners,1039

James Gleick,"New York Times Bestseller: This life story of the quirky physicist is “a thorough and masterful portrait of one of the great minds of the century” (The New York Review of Books). Raised in Depression-era Rockaway Beach, physicist Richard Feynman was irreverent, eccentric, and childishly enthusiastic—a new kind of scientist in a field that was in its infancy. His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where the giddy young man held his own among the nation’s greatest minds. There, Feynman turned theory into practice, culminating in the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, when the Atomic Age was born. He was only twenty-seven.

James Frey,"A story of drug and alcohol abuse and rehabilitation as it has never been told before. Recounted in visceral, kinetic prose, and crafted with a forthrightness that rejects piety, cynicism, and self-pity, it brings us face-to-face with a provocative new understanding of the nature of addiction and the meaning of recovery. By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facilityís doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of detoxification and withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughsís Junky. But A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is -- including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak ó but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinicís droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become--which runs directly counter to his counselors' recipes for recovery. James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, that is at the heart of A Million Little Pieces:  the fight between one young manís will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart. A Million Little Pieces is an uncommonly genuine account of a life destroyed and a life reconstructed. It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\James Frey\A Million Little Pieces (1043)\cover.jpg,9780307276902,2004-02-15T13:10:25+00:00,Random House,,,1.0,"Fiction, Biography & Autobiography, Substance Abuse & Addictions, Personal Memoirs, SELF-HELP, General, Twelve-Step Programs, Disease & Health Issues, Social Science",A Million Little Pieces,1043

He has shown us, as Diana Gabaldon said, ""the bone beneath the flesh of legend."" In his last book in this series, we witnessed the young king pull the sword from the stone and begin his journey to greatness. Now we reach the tale itself-how the most shining court in history was made.Clothar is a young man of promise. He has been sent from the wreckage of Gaul to one of the few schools remaining, where logic and rhetoric are taught along with battle techniques that will allow him to survive in the cruel new world where the veneer of civilization is held together by barbarism. He is sent by his mentor on a journey to aid another young man: Arthur Pendragon. He is a man who wants to replace barbarism with law, and keep those who work only for destruction at bay. He is seen, as the last great hope for all that is good.Clothar is drawn to this man, and together they build a dream too perfect to last--and, with a special woman, they share a love that will nearly destroy them all...The name of Clothar may be unknown to modern readers, for tales change in the telling through centuries.

Jack Kerouac,"A 50th anniversary hardcover edition of Kerouac's classic novel that defined a generation Few novels have had as profound an impact on American culture as On the Road. Pulsating with the rhythms of 1950s underground America, jazz, sex, illicit drugs, and the mystery and promise of the open road, Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be “beat” and has inspired generations of writers, musicians, artists, poets, and seekers who cite their discovery of the book as the event that “set them free.” Based on Kerouac's adventures with Neal Cassady, On the Road tells the story of two friends whose four cross-country road trips are a quest for meaning and true experience. Written with a mixture of sad-eyed naïveté and wild abandon, and imbued with Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz, On the Road is the quintessential American vision of freedom and hope, a book that changed American literature and changed anyone who has ever picked it up. This hardcover edition commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the first publication of the novel in 1957 and will be a must-have for any literature lover.  @Didn'tTypeOnTP!

J.K. Rowling,"The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a Wizarding classic, first came to Muggle readers' attention in the book known as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Now, thanks to Hermione Granger's new translation from the ancient runes, we present this stunning edition with an introduction, notes, and illustrations by J. K. Rowling, and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore. Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales: ""The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,"" ""The Fountain of Fair Fortune,"" ""The Warlock's Hairy Heart,"" ""Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,"" and of course, ""The Tale of the Three Brothers."" But not only are they the equal of fairy tales we now know and love, reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter.  The stories are accompanied by delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by Ms. Rowling herself, featuring a still-life frontispiece for each one. Professor Dumbledore's commentary--apparently written some eighteen months before his death--reveals not just his vast knowledge of Wizarding lore, but also more of his personal qualities: his sense of humor, his courage, his pride in his abilities, and his hard-won wisdom. Names familiar from the Harry Potter novels sprinkle the pages, including Aberforth Dumbledore, Lucius Malfoy and his forebears, and Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (or ""Nearly Headless Nick""), as well as other professors at Hogwarts and the past owners of the Elder Wand. Dumbledore tells us of incidents unique to the Wizarding world, like hilariously troubled theatrical productions at Hogwarts or the dangers of having a ""hairy heart."" But he also reveals aspects of the Wizarding world that his Muggle readers might find all too familiar, like censorship, intolerance, and questions about the deepest mysteries in life.  Altogether, this is an essential addition to our store of knowledge about the world and the magic that J. K. Rowling has created, and a book every true Harry Potter fan will want to have for their shelves.  This purchase also represents another very important form of giving: From every sale of this book, Scholastic will give its net proceeds to the CHILDREN'S HIGH LEVEL GROUP, a charity cofounded in 2005 by J.K.

He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley — a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry — and anyone who reads about him — will find unforgettable.For it's here that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him...if Harry can survive the encounter.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J.

J. K. Rowling,"For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, He's at Hogwarts . . . he's at Hogwarts. Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends.

J. K. Rowling,"This book ""follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the Daily Prophet) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teenager. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny from the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth: that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toad-like and simpering (""hem, hem"") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of defence against dark arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the high inquisitor of Hogwarts. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their examinations, devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team line-up, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested."" - product description.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J.

J. K. Rowling,"In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder. Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning- we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a 'nice deserted moor.' As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes 'squealing the names of the players' as well as 'tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.' Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own- 'The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This Daily Prophet scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J. K.

"Rowling, J. K.","In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the summer after Harry’s first year at Hogwarts has been his worst summer ever… the Dursleys more distant and horrible than ever before. But just as he’s packing his bags to return to school, a creature named Dobby the house-elf announces that if Harry goes back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And it turns out, Dobby is right. Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls&#39; bathroom; the strange behavior of Ron&#39;s little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the &quot;Chamber of Secrets,&quot; a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the Wizarding world, even affecting Harry&#39;s friend Hermione. But all of these seem like minor concerns when someone starts turning Hogwarts students to stone: an evildoer said to be the fearsome Heir of Salazar Slytherin, on of the founders of the school. Could it be Draco Malfoy, Harry&#39;s most poisonous rival? Could it be Hagrid whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one person everyone at Hogwarts most suspects: Harry Potter himself?","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Rowling, J.

J. D. Salinger,"J. D. Salinger wrote one of the most famous books ever written, The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger wrote many stories and, in 1941, after several rejections, Salinger finally cracked The New Yorker, with a story, ""Slight Rebellion Off Madison,"" that was an early sketch of what became a scene in ""The Catcher in the Rye"". The magazine then had second thoughts in part because of World War II in which Salinger was in combat, and held the story for five years before finally publishing it in 1946, buried in the back of an issue. Everyone was surprised when the story and the book that followed it became a bit hit. Even today nobody can really explain why Catcher in the Rye is so famous and so popular. Yet, millions have been sold and are still being sold even though only available as used books nowadays. When The Catcher in the Rye was published in 1951, it was registered for copyright as ""additional material"". This obviously referred to the earlier work ""Slight Rebellion Off Madison"". The copyright page on ""The Catcher in the Rye"" states ""Copyright 1945, 1946, 1951 by J. D Salinger"". The date of 1945 obviously refers to the publication of ""I'm Crazy"", a short story written by Salinger and published in the December 22, 1945 issue of Collier's magazine that first introduced the character Holden Caulfield to the reading public. Salinger later reworked this short story to incorporate it into The Catcher in the Rye. The two earlier stories are ""I'm Crazy"", an early version of Holden's departure from prep school that later shows up in The Catcher in the Rye. With minor alteration, much of this story is familiar to readers as the chapter where Holden visits Mr. Spencer. What sets this story apart is the presence of an additional Caulfield sister and the clarity of Holden's resignation and compromise at the end. ""Slight Rebellion off Madison"" is an early version of another scene in The Catcher in the Rye. The story follows Holden when he is home from Pency and goes to the movies, then skating with Sally Hayes, followed by his drunken calls to her apartment late at night. An early story, it is the first of Salinger's Caulfied works to be accepted for publication.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J. D.

J. R. R. Tolkien; Christopher Tolkien; Ted Nasmith,"SUMMARY: The tales of The Silmarillion were the underlying inspiration and source of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing; he worked on the book throughout his life but never brought it to a final form. Long preceding in its origins The Lord of the Rings, it is the story of the First Age of Tolkien's world, the ancient drama to which characters in The Lord of the RIngs look back and in which some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The title Silmarillion is shortened from Quenta Silmarillion, ""The History of the Silmarils,"" the three great jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves, in which he imprisoned the light of the Two Trees that illumined Valinor, the land of the gods. When Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, destroyed the Trees, that light lived on only in the Silmarils; Morgoth seized them and set them in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his people against the gods, their exile in Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroisim of Elves and Men, against the great Enemy. The book includes several other, shorter works beside The Silmarillion proper. Preceding it are ""Ainulindale,"" the myth of Creation, and ""Valaquenta,"" in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is set forth. After The Silmarillion is ""Akallabeth,"" the story of the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; completing the volume is ""Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,"" in which the events of The Lord of the Rings are treated in the manner of The Silmarillion. This new edition of The Silmarillion contains the revised and corrected ""second edition"" text and, by way of introduction, a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien in 1951, which provides a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages. It also contains almost fifty full-color illustrations by the artist Ted Nasmith, many of which appear for the first time.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\J. R. R.

Trading on his reputation, he speaks for enormous fees, lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions, and half-heartedly heads a government-backed initiative tackling global warming. While he coasts along in his professional life, Michael's personal life is another matter entirely. His fifth marriage is crumbling under the weight of his infidelities. But this time the tables are turned: His wife is having an affair, and Michael realizes he is still in love with her.  When Michael's personal and professional lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways, an opportunity presents itself in the guise of an invitation to travel to New Mexico. Here is a chance for him to extricate himself from his marital problems, reinvigorate his career, and very possibly save the world from environmental disaster.

Ian McEwan,"On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her sister, Cecilia, strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching her is Robbie Turner, her childhood friend who, like Cecilia, has recently come down from Cambridge. By the end of that day, the lives of all three will have been changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had not even imagined at its start, and will have become victims of the younger girl's imagination. Briony will have witnessed mysteries and committed a crime that creates in her a sense of guilt that will color her entire life. Ian McEwan has in each of his novels drawn the reader brilliantly into the intimate lives and situations of his characters. But never before has he written on a canvas so large: taking the reader from a manor house in England in 1935, to the retreat to Dunkirk in 1941, to a London hospital soon after where the maimed, broken, and dying soldiers are shipped from the evacuation, to a reunion of the Tallis clan in 1999.

For one brother it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, even without knowing the full truth, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever.

Iain Banks,"Overview: The Twin Novae battle had been one of the last of the Idiran war, and one of the most horrific: desperate to avert their inevitable defeat, the Idirans had induced not one but two suns to explode, snuffing out worlds and biospheres teeming with sentient life. They were attacks of incredible proportion - giga-death crimes. But the war ended, and life went on. Now, eight hundred years later, light from the first explosion is about to reach the Masaq 'Orbital, home to the Culture's most adventurous and decadent souls. There it will fall upon Masaq's 50 billion inhabitants, gathered to commemorate the deaths of the innocent and to reflect, if only for a moment, on what some call the Culture's own complicity in the terrible event. Also journeying to Masaq' is Major Quinlan, an emissary from the war-ravaged world of Chel. In the aftermath of the conflict that split his world apart, most believe he has come to Masaq' to bring home Chel's most brilliant star and self-exiled dissident, the honored Composer Ziller. Ziller claims he will do anything to avoid a meeting with Major Quinlan, whom he suspects has come to murder him. But the Major's true assignment will have far greater consequences than the death of a mere political dissident, as part of a conspiracy more ambitious than even he can know - a mission his superiors have buried so deeply in his mind that even he cannot remember it.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Iain Banks\Look to Windward (1127)\cover.jpg,9780743421928,2002-02-15T13:04:54+00:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Fiction, Science fiction, Fiction - Science Fiction, General, Space Opera, Caste, Science Fiction - General",Look to Windward,1127

Hugh Ambrose,"Penguin delivers you to the front lines of The Pacific Theater with the real-life stories behind the HBO miniseries.Between America's retreat from China in late November 1941 and the moment General MacArthur's airplane touched down on the Japanese mainland in August of 1945, five men connected by happenstance fought the key battles of the war against Japan. From the debacle in Bataan, to the miracle at Midway and the relentless vortex of Guadalcanal, their solemn oaths to their country later led one to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot and the others to the coral strongholds of Peleliu, the black terraces of Iwo Jima and the killing fields of Okinawa, until at last the survivors enjoyed a triumphant, yet uneasy, return home.  In The Pacific, Hugh Ambrose focuses on the real-life stories of the five men who put their lives on the line for our country. To deepen the story revealed in the miniseries and go beyond it, the book dares to chart a great ocean of enmity known as The Pacific and the brave men who fought. Some considered war a profession, others enlisted as citizen soldiers. Each man served in a different part of the war, but their respective duties required every ounce of their courage and their strength to defeat an enemy who preferred suicide to surrender.

Directed by Darren Aronofsky, the highly acclaimed director of Pi, the movie was released in November 2000. In this searing novel, two young hoods, Harry and Tyrone, and a girlfriend fantasize about scoring a pound of uncut heroin and getting rich.

Homer,"The Odyssey, by Homer, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:  New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate  All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Long before The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Harry Potter, the ancient Greek poet Homer established the standard for tales of epic quests and heroic journeys with The Odyssey. Crowded with characters, both human and non-human, and bursting with action, The Odyssey details the adventures of Odysseus, king of Ithaca and hero of the Trojan War, as he struggles to return to his home and his waiting, ever-faithful wife, Penelope. Along the way he encounters the seductive Circe, who changes men into swi≠ the gorgeous water-nymph, Calypso, who keeps him a ""prisoner of love” for seven years; the terrible, one-eyed, man-eating giant Cyclops; and a host of other ogres, wizards, sirens, and gods. But when he finally reaches Ithaca after ten years of travel, his trials have only begun. There he must battle the scheming noblemen who, thinking him dead, have demanded that Penelope choose one of them to be her new husband--and Ithaca’s new king. Often called the ""second work of Western literature” (The Iliad, also by Homer, being the first), The Odyssey is not only a rousing adventure drama, but also a profound meditation on courage, loyalty, family, fate, and undying love. More than three thousand years old, it was the first story to delineate carefully and exhaustively a single character arc -- a narrative structure that serves as the foundation and heart of the modern novel. Robert Squillace’s revision of George Herbert Palmer’s classic prose translation captures the drama and vitality of adventure, while remaining true to the original Homeric language. Robert Squillace teaches in the Cultural Foundations division of New York University’s General Studies Program.

Ralph E. Blakely & Homer,"One of the most important and influential works of the Western Canon, The Iliad has long been a favorite of scholars and laypeople, embraced by famed artists from Shakespeare to Brad Pitt.The Iliad opens in the late stages of the Trojan War, and, with reflection on prior battles, follows through the sacking of Troy and the Greeks' bitter victory. Spanning the defeats, allegiances, victories, and vengeances of mortals and Gods alike, this epic poem of the ages still manages to be intensely relevant to modern readers. The major thematic thrusts (glory, honor, wrath, and fate) are both the stuff of legend and part of our ongoing experience. Now, in an updated prose translation from the original Greek, Blakely focuses his Iliad on the gripping heroics of Achilles and Patroclus, recounting a relatable tale of angry young men striving for glory, trapped by fate into prescribed warrior roles.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ralph E.

Anne Boleyn is dead, decapitated in the space of a heartbeat by a hired French executioner. As her remains are bundled into oblivion, Thomas Cromwell breakfasts with the victors. The blacksmith’s son from Putney emerges from the spring’s bloodbath to continue his climb to power and wealth, while his formidable master, Henry VIII, settles to short-lived happiness with his third queen, Jane Seymour. Cromwell is a man with only his wits to rely on; he has no great family to back him, no private army. Despite rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad and the threat of invasion testing Henry’s regime to breaking point, Cromwell’s robust imagination sees a new country in the mirror of the future. But can a nation, or a person, shed the past like a skin? Do the dead continually unbury themselves? What will you do, the Spanish ambassador asks Cromwell, when the king turns on you, as sooner or later he turns on everyone close to him? With The Mirror and the Light, Hilary Mantel brings to a triumphant close the trilogy she began with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.

Hermann Hesse,"Nobel prize-winning author Hermann Hesse imagined life in India during the lifetime of the Buddha to create this memorable tale about a restless seeker of enlightenment. First published in 1922, Siddhartha employs powerful symbolism to impart its timeless teachings.The story concerns a young Brahman who quits his comfortable home to join a roving group of holy men in striving to empty their hearts of passion and desire through self-denial and meditation. Discouraged by his failure to find Nirvana after three years of the strictest asceticism, the young seeker turns to the fleshly world, where he becomes a wealthy merchant and partakes of sensual pleasures with a sophisticated courtesan. Years of materialistic self-indulgence numb Siddhartha&#39;s soul, but at his moment of greatest despondency, he begins to experience his long-sought spiritual awakening. True enlightenment, he realizes, cannot be received from the lessons of others; it must be attained through individual struggle.

Henry Miller,"Shocking, banned and the subject of obscenity trials, Henry Miller's first novel Tropic of Cancer is one of the most scandalous and influential books of the twentieth centuryTropic of Cancer redefined the novel. Set in Paris in the 1930s, it features a starving American writer who lives a bohemian life among prostitutes, pimps, and artists. Banned in the US and the UK for more than thirty years because it was considered pornographic, Tropic of Cancer continued to be distributed in France and smuggled into other countries. When it was first published in the US in 1961, it led to more than 60 obscenity trials until a historic ruling by the Supreme Court defined it as a work of literature. Long hailed as a truly liberating book, daring and uncompromising, Tropic of Cancer is a cornerstone of modern literature that asks us to reconsider everything we know about art, freedom, and morality.'At last an unprintable book that is fit to read' Ezra Pound 'A momentous event in the history of modern writing' Samuel Beckett 'The book that forever changed the way American literature would be written' Erica Jong Henry Miller (1891-1980) is one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.

Henry James,"With an Introduction and Notes by Pat Righelato, University of Reading. Daisy Miller is one of Henry James's most attractive heroines: she represents youth and frivolity. As a tourist in Italy, her American freedom and freshness of spirit come up against the corruption and hypocrisy of European manners. From its first publication, readers on both sides of the Atlantic have quarrelled about her, defending or attacking the liberties that Daisy takes and the conventions that she ignores. All three tales in this collection, 'Daisy Miller', 'An International Episode' and 'Lady Barbarina', express James's most notable subject, ""the international theme"", the encounters, romantic and cultural, between Americans and Europeans. His heroes and heroines approach each other on unfamiliar ground with new freedoms, yet find themselves unexpectedly hampered by old constraints. In 'An International Episode', an English lord visiting Newport, Rhode Island, falls in love with an American girl, but their relationship becomes more complicated when she travels to London. In the light-hearted comedy 'Lady Barbarina', a rich young American seeks an English aristocratic bride. The unusual outcomes of these three tales pose a number of social questions about marriage and the traditional roles of men and women. Is an international marriage symbolic of the highest cultural fusion of values or is it an old style raid and capture? Is marriage to remain the feminine destination? AUTHOR: Although born in the United States, Henry James (1843-1916) was educated in Europe, and spend most of his later life in England, eventually becoming a British citizen. His novels often illustrate the clash of cultures between America and Europe, and in truth were not particularly popular during his lifetime, particularly in the country of his birth. In recent years, his novels have been adapted for film and television, and his supernatural stories, particularly 'The Turn of the Screw', remain highly regarded.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Henry James\Daisy Miller and Other Stories (1143)\cover.jpg,9781853262135,1994-02-15T12:35:29+00:00,Wordsworth Editions,,,1.0,"Fiction, Classics, General Fiction",Daisy Miller and Other Stories,1143

A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel—a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man's struggle for justice—but the weight of history will only tolerate so much.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works.Who has not laughed at the emperor''s new clothes, thrilled to the song of the nightingale, or sympathized with the ugly duckling? In the 170 years since they first began to appear, Hans Christian Andersen''s Fairy Tales have entranced and bewitched millions of readers, adults and children alike.  Writing in the midst of a Europe-wide rebirth of national literature, Anderson broke new ground with his fairy tales in two important ways. First, he composed them in the vernacular, mimicking the language he used in telling them to children aloud. Second, he set his tales in his own land and time, giving rise to his loving descriptions of the Danish countryside. In contrast to such folklorists as the Brothers Grimm, Anderson''s tales are grounded in the real and often focus on the significance of small or overlooked things. Here are all of Andersen''s collected tales, many--such as ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Red Shoes,"" and ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier""--still popular through modern adaptations, and others, including ""The Flying Trunk"" and ""The Most Incredible Thing,"" well worth rediscovering. Jack Zipes is professor of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota. A specialist in folklore and fairy tales, he has authored numerous books of criticism over the last thirty years and edited several major anthologies, including the Norton Anthology of Children''s Literature (2005).

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. The Time Machine, H. G. Wells's first novel, is a tale of Darwinian evolution taken to its extreme. Its hero, a young scientist, travels 800,000 years into the future and discovers a dying earth populated by two strange humanoid species: the brutal Morlocks and the gentle but nearly helpless Eloi.The Invisible Man mixes chilling terror, suspense, and acute psychological understanding into a tale of an equally adventurous scientist who discovers the formula for invisibility—a secret that drives him mad.Immensely popular during his lifetime, H. G. Wells, along with Jules Verne, is credited with inventing science fiction. This new volume offers two of Wells's best-loved and most critically acclaimed “scientific romances.” In each, the author grounds his fantastical imagination in scientific fact and conjecture while lacing his narrative with vibrant action, not merely to tell a “ripping yarn,” but to offer a biting critique on the world around him. “The strength of Mr. Wells,” wrote Arnold Bennett, “lies in the fact that he is not only a scientist, but a most talented student of character, especially quaint character. He will not only ingeniously describe for you a scientific miracle, but he will set down that miracle in the midst of a country village, sketching with excellent humour the inn-landlady, the blacksmith, the chemist's apprentice, the doctor, and all the other persons whom the miracle affects.” Alfred Mac Adam teaches literature at Barnard College-Columbia University.

""I assure you, on my honour, he left a little earlier than usual, for he had a business appointment with some gentlemen. But you'll find him, I tell you again, at Bouttevilain's, in the Rue Saint-Martin, No. 92, the second row of steps at the left, at the end of the courtyard--first floor--door to the right!"" At last, he saw Regimbart, in a cloud of tobacco-smoke, by himself, at the lower end of the refreshment-room, near the billiard-table, with a glass of beer in front of him, and his chin lowered in a thoughtful attitude. ""Ah! I have been a long time searching for you!"" Without rising, Regimbart extended towards him only two fingers, and, as if he had seen Frederick the day before, he gave utterance to a number of commonplace remarks about the opening of the session. Frederick interrupted him, saying in the most natural tone he could assume: ""Is Arnoux going on well?"" The reply was a long time coming, as Regimbart was gargling the liquor in his throat: ""Yes, not badly."" ""Where is he living now?"" ""Why, in the Rue Paradis Poissonniere,"" the Citizen returned with astonishment. ', What number? "" 5 G. F.--ii ""Thirty-seven--confound it! what a funny fellow you are!"" Frederick rose. ""What! are you going?"" ""Yes, yes! I have to make a call--some business matter I had forgotten! Good-bye!""

Gustave Flaubert & Eleanor Marx Aveling,"As a provocative tale of passion and complacency, ideals and self-delusions, Madame Bovary (1857) remains a milestone in European fiction. In telling his story of Emma Bovary—a farmer's daughter who, with girlhood dreams fuelled by sensational novels, marries a provincial doctor—Flaubert inaugurated a literary mode that would be called Realism. But so exacting were Flaubert's standards of authenticity that his portrayal of the breakdown of Emma's marriage, and the frankness with which he treats her adulterous liaisons, scandalized many of his contemporaries. Yet to others, the mix of painful introspection, emotional blindness, and cynical self-seeking that distinguishes his characters made the novel instantly recognizable as a work of genius. It is a novel fixed upon the idea of romance—of the need for Romance—in the face of day-to-day banalities. It is a theme that is ironic insofar as the exquisite clarity of Flaubert's prose serves to hauntingly underline the futility of the heroine's ultimate tragedy.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Gustave Flaubert\Madame Bovary (Illustrated) (1154)\cover.jpg,9783736802605,2014-04-23T14:06:12+01:00,BookRix,,,1.0,"Fiction, General, Classics",Madame Bovary (Illustrated),1154

George R. R. Martin,"THE BOOK BEHIND THE FOURTH SEASON OF THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin's monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.  A FEAST FOR CROWS It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King's Landing. Robb Stark's demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist--or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out.  But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces--some familiar, others only just appearing--are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead.  It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives.

George R. R. Martin,"Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon--who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead . . . victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky--a comet the color of blood and flame--six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel . . . and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors.

Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned--a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible.  When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell's masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\George Orwell\Animal Farm_ A Fairy Story (1174)\cover.jpg,9780451526342,1996-02-15T12:16:05+00:00,Signet Classics,,,1.0,"Animals in literature, Audiobooks, General, Political fiction, Readers for new literates, Domestic animals, Social problems in literature, Literature - Classics, Fables, Criticism, English language, Political, Literature: Classics, Totalitarianism, Satire, Fiction, Encyclopedias & General Reference, Utopias, Science fiction, Literature & literary studies, Classics, Literary, Allegories",Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,1174

George Carlin;Tony Hendra,"SUMMARY: As one of America's preeminent comedic voices, George Carlin saw it all throughout his extraordinary fifty-year career and made fun of most of it. Last Words is the story of the man behind some of the most seminal comedy of the last half century, blending his signature acer-bic humor with never-before-told stories from his own life.In 1993 George Carlin asked his friend and bestselling author Tony Hendra to help him write his autobiography. For almost fifteen years, in scores of conversations, many of them recorded, the two discussed Carlin's life, times, and evolution as a major artist. When Carlin died at age seventy-one in June 2008 with the book still unpublished, Hendra set out to assemble it as his friend would have wanted. Last Words is the result, the rollicking, wrenching story of Carlin's life from birth -- literally -- to his final years, as well as a parting gift of laughter to the world of comedy he helped create.George Carlin's journey to stardom began in the rough-and-tumble neighborhood of New York's Upper West Side in the 1940s, where class and culture wars planted the seeds for some of his best known material, including the notorious ""Seven Words You Can Never Say On Television."" His early conflicts, his long struggle with substance abuse, his turbulent relationships with his family, and his triumphs over catastrophic setbacks all fueled the unique comedic worldview he brought to the stage. From the heights of stardom to the low points few knew about, Last Words is told with the same razor-sharp honesty that made Carlin one of the best loved comedians in American history.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\George Carlin;Tony Hendra\Last Words (1176)\cover.jpg,9781439172957,2009-09-15T06:00:00+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"United States, Performing Arts, Autobiography, Entertainment & Performing Arts - Comedians, Entertainment & Performing Arts - General, Biography & Autobiography, Entertainment & Performing Arts, Comedy (Performing Arts), Biography, Comedians, Biography And Autobiography, Comedians - United States, Comedy, Carlin, George, Rich & Famous",Last Words,1176
George Carlin,"On the heels of George Carlin's #1 New York Times bestseller Napalm & Silly Putty comes When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? -- infused with Carlin's trademark irreverent humor and biting cultural observations. Here we go again . . . George Carlin's hilarious When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? offers his cutting-edge opinions and observational humor on everything from evasive euphemistic language to politicians to the media to dead people. Nothing and no one is safe! Despite the current climate of political correctness, Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics:Carlin on the media: The media comprises equal parts business, politics, advertising, public relations, and show business. Nice combination. Enough bull for Texas to open a chain of branch offices.Carlin on the battle of the sexes: Here's all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid.Carlin on hygiene: When did they pass a law that says the people who make my sandwich have to be wearing gloves? I'm not comfortable with this. I don't want glove residue all over my food; it's not sanitary. Who knows where these gloves have been?Carlin on evasive language: Just to demonstrate how far using euphemisms in language has gone, some psychologists are now actually referring to ugly people as those with ""severe appearance deficits."" Hey, Doctor. How's that for ""denial""?Carlin on politics: No self-respecting politician would ever admit to working in the government. They prefer to think of themselves ""serving the nation."" To help visualize the service they provide the country, you may wish to picture the things that take place on a stud farm. The thinking person's comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin puts voice to issues that capture the modern imagination. For instance, why are there Ten Commandments? Are UFOs real? What will the future really be like? This brand-new collection tackles all that and more. In When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?

George Carlin,"A hilarious new collection of razor-sharp observations from the New York Times bestselling author of Brain Droppings. Few comics make the transition from stage to page as smoothly or successfully as George Carlin. Brain Droppings spent a total of 40 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and this new one is certain to tickle even more ribs (and rattle a few more cages) with its characteristically ironic take on life's annoying universal truths. In Napalm & Silly Putty, Carlin doesn't steer clear of the tough issues, preferring instead to look life boldly in the eye to pose the questions few dare to ask:How can it be a spy satellite if they announce on TV that it's a spy satellite?Why do they bother saying ""raw sewage""? Do some people cook that stuff?In the expression ""topsy-turvy,"" what exactly is meant by ""turvy""? And he makes some startling observations, including:Most people with low self-esteem have earned it.Guys don't seem to be called ""Lefty"" anymore.Most people don't know what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it. Carlin also waxes wickedly philosophical on all sorts of subjects, including:KIDS--They're not all cute. In fact, if you look at them closely, some of them are rather unpleasant looking. And a lot of them don't smell too good either.DEATH ROW--If you're condemned to die they have to give you one last meal of your own request. What is that all about? A group of people plan to kill you, so they want you to eat something you like? Add to the mix ""The Ten Most Embarrassing Songs of All Time,"" ""The 20th Century Hostility Scoreboard,"" and ""People I Can Do Without,"" and you have an irresistibly insouciant assortment of musings, questions, assertions, and assumptions guaranteed to please the millions of fans waiting for the next Carlin collection--and the millions more waiting to discover this comic genius.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\George Carlin\Napalm & Silly Putty (1178)\cover.jpg,9780786871599,2001-07-01T14:13:32+01:00,Hachette UK,,,1.0,"Humor, Form, Essays, Topic, Politics, General",Napalm & Silly Putty,1178

Gary Taubes,"What’s making us fat? And how can we change? Building upon his critical work in Good Calories, Bad Calories and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, bestselling author Gary Taubes revisits these urgent questions. Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century—none more damaging or misguided than the “calories-in, calories-out” model of why we get fat—and the good science that has been ignored. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight?

Gary Taubes,"For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less and exercising more. Yet despite this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates, like white flour, easily digested starches, and sugars, and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. Called “a very important book,” by Andrew Weil and …” destined to change the way we think about food,” by Michael Pollan,  this groundbreaking book by award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Gary Taubes\Good Calories, Bad Calories (1183)\cover.jpg",9780307267948,2007-09-25T13:50:46+01:00,Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Health & Fitness, Diet & Nutrition, Diets, Healthy Living, Nutrition","Good Calories, Bad Calories",1183
Garth Stein,"Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.   Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.   On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, ZoË, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with ZoË at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man.

Fyodor Dostoevsky,"Dostoevsky's last and greatest novel, The Karamazov Brothers (1880) is both a brilliantly told crime story and a passionate philosophical debate. The dissolute landowner Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered; his sons - the atheist intellectual Ivan, the hot-blooded Dmitry, and the saintly novice Alyosha - are all at some level involved. Bound up with this intense family drama is Dostoevsky's exploration of many deeply felt ideas about the existence of God, the question of human freedom, the collective nature of guilt, the disatrous consequences of rationalism. The novel is also richly comic: the Russian Orthodox Church, the legal system, and even the authors most cherished causes and beliefs are presented with a note of irreverence, so that orthodoxy, and radicalism, sanity and madness, love and hatred, right and wrong are no longer mutually exclusive. Rebecca West considered it ""the allegory for the world's maturity"", but with children to the fore. This new translation does full justice to Doestoevsky's genius, particularly in the use of the spoken word, which ranges over every mode of human expression.

Fyodor Dostoevsky,"Into a compellingly real portrait of nineteenth-century Russian society, Dostoevsky introduces his ideal hero, the saintly Prince Myshkin. The tensions subsequently unleashed by the hero's innocence, truthfulness, and humility betray the inadequacy of his moral idealism and disclose the spiritual emptiness of a society that cannot accommodate him. Myshkin's mission ends in idiocy and darkness, but it is the world that is rotten, not he. Written under appalling personal circumstances when Dostoevsky was travelling in Europe, The Idiot not only reveals the author's acute artistic sense and penetrating psychological insight, but also affords his most incisive indictment of Russia's struggling to emulate contemporary Europe and sinking under the weight of Western materialism.

Fyodor Dostoevsky & Jessie Coulson,"Crime and Punishment is the story of a murder committed on principle, of a killer who wishes by his action to set himself outside and above society. A novel of fearful tension, physical, and psychological, it is pervaded by Dostoevsky's sinister evocation of St Petersburg, yet in the life of its gloomy tenements and drink-shops provides moments of wild humour. Crime and Punishment was marked by Dostoevsky's own harrowing experiences. He had himself undergone interrogation and trial, and was condemned to death, a sentence commuted to penal servitude. In prison he was particularly impressed by one hardened murderer who seemed to have attained a spiritual equilibrium beyond good and evil: yet witnessing the misery of other convicts also engendered in Dostoevsky a belief in the Christian idea of salvation through suffering.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,"1. Nietzsche remains one of the most influential philosophers of our time. As Walter Kaufmann notes, 'No other philosopher since Plato and Aristotle, with the exception of Kant and Hegel, has influenced so many widely different thinkers and writers so profoundly.' What are some of the main aspects of Nietzsche's influence, and what are some of the factors that account for his tremendous and enduring influence? 2. One of Nietzsche's major themes is the idea of 'the eternal recurrence.' What do you think Nietzsche was attempting to do with this idea? What does he seem to mean by it? What are its implications? 3. As Peter Gay notes, Nietzsche has been one of the most persistently misunderstood writers in the history of Western thought. What are some of the misunderstandings that have attended his work? Are some thinkers more easily misappropriated than others? 4. Nietzsche's style is particularly iconoclastic and unique; as Walter Kaufmann notes, 'Nietzsche clearly wanted to be read with a delighted awareness of nuances of style and thought.' Discuss how Nietzsche's style-which often condenses complex ideas into seemingly simple phrases-works to inform your reading or understanding of his thought. Is Nietzsche's style inseparable from his meaning? 5. One of Nietzsche's favorite devices is the aphorism. Why is this form significant for Nietzsche? What does he accomplish by writing in this way? Can all of his writing be said to be in some way aphoristic? 6. For Nietzsche, the most important philosophy is always 'untimely,' and Nietzsche had a particularly complicated and contentious relationship toward many of his contemporaries, for instance Wagner. Discuss Nietzsche's various attitudes toward his contemporaries as stated in Basic Writings, and conversely the ideas, figures, and ways of thinking that Nietzsche seems to find most sympathetic to his own philosophy. 7. Nietzsche has been considered a nihilist, and also a philosopher who more than anything sought to transcend nihilism. Discuss the idea of nihilism in broad terms, and Nietzsche's use or development of this idea. 8. What, for Nietzsche, is the 'will to power'? 9. Throughout Nietzsche's work is a call for a new philosophy, for radical breaks with various conventional ideas and methodologies, and for new philosophers.

A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave is a  memoir and treatise on abolition written by former slave, Frederick  Douglass. The text, first published in 1845, describes the events of his  life and encompasses eleven chapters that recount Douglass&#39; life as a  slave and his ambition to become a free man. It is considered to be one  of the most influential pieces of literature to fuel the abolitionist  movement of the early 19th century in the United States. 2.

The novella,  published in 1852, was Douglass&#39; first and only published work of  fiction. 3.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:   New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate  All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world''s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man''s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka''s masterpiece, ""The Metamorphosis,"" a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. Bringing together some of Kafka''s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author''s artistry. ""The Judgment,"" which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and ""The Stoker,"" which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with ""The Metamorphosis,"" form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as ""The Sons,"" and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family. Also included are ""In the Penal Colony,"" a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and ""A Hunger Artist,"" about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public. Kafka''s lucid, succinct writing chronicles the labyrinthine complexities, the futility-laden horror, and the stifling oppressiveness that permeate his vision of modern life.

Ernest Hemingway & Sparknotes,"In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from ""the good fight,"" For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving and wise. ""If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,"" Maxwell Perkins wrote to Hemingway after reading the manuscript, ""no one ever so completely performed it."" Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author's previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ernest Hemingway\For Whom the Bell Tolls (1221)\cover.jpg,9781586638306,2003-06-13T13:47:47+01:00,Spark Pub.,,,1.0,"Fiction, American - General, Study Aids, Test Prep, Antiques & Collectibles, Study Guides, General, Book Notes, Literary, War & Military",For Whom the Bell Tolls,1221

Erik Larson,"In The Devil in the White City, the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.  Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his ""World's Fair Hotel"" just west of the fairgrounds--a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium.  Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.  The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. Erik Larson's gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.

Erich Maria Remarque,"Considered by many the greatest war novel of all time, All Quiet on the Western Front is Erich Maria Remarque's masterpiece of the German experience during World War I.  I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. . . .  This is the testament of Paul Bäumer, who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty, culture, and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches.  Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive.

Eduardo Viveiros de Castro,"O volume inclui os principais textos que tornaram Eduardo Viveiros de Castro um dos mais influentes pensadores brasileiros da atualidade, no período que vai desde seu mestrado, em 1976, até 2000. Em grande parte centrados nas sociedades amazônicas, os oito ensaios são baseados em artigos publicados que foram selecionados e revistos pelo autor. Do forte diálogo entre a antropologia e a filosofia resultam conceitos-chave da obra do autor, como predação, troca, afinidade potencial e perspectivismo – o qual permite entender como os índios enxergam os animais e a si próprios. A disposição cronológica dos ensaios revela ao leitor o processo de amadurecimento de tais conceitos ao longo da trajetória do autor. Conforme lembra o antropólogo no prefácio, a antropologia é sempre um exercício de tradução de uma cultura segundo outra. Reconstituir a imaginação indígena nos termos da nossa implicaria, portanto, algumas imprecisões. No entanto, se o exercício é bem feito, atinge-se o ponto em que transformamos o que entendemos em nossos termos em algo cujo significado se aproxima daquilo que os índios entendem nos termos deles. Ou seja, trata-se de um processo onde não somente a imaginação dos povos indígenas está em jogo, mas também a nossa; no qual os conceitos vão se distanciando cada vez mais de seus sentidos usuais e vão tomando novas formas. O livro traz ainda entrevista com o autor – feita por jovens antropólogos da revista Sexta Feira – onde ele trata de seu percurso sob uma abordagem mais concreta. Ele revela, por exemplo, como se deu sua passagem de estudioso de antropologia urbana para um de etnologia indígena, e sua entrada na Amazônia, território ainda relativamente inexplorado mesmo dentro de sua disciplina. A coleção Argonautas traça uma linhagem do pensamento antropológico que tem como centro de força o estruturalismo de Claude Lévi-Strauss e que se ramifica em autores que inovaram e revolucionaram seus campos de pesquisa a partir de etnografias.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Eduardo Viveiros de Castro\A inconstancia da alma selvagem (1241)\cover.jpg,9788592886295,2017-04-10T13:57:53+01:00,Ubu Editora LTDA - ME,,,1.0,"Social Science, Ethnic Studies, Native American Studies, Anthropology, Cultural & Social",A inconstância da alma selvagem,1241

Edmund Morris,"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE AND THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD - Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time This classic biography is the story of seven men--a naturalist, a writer, a lover, a hunter, a ranchman, a soldier, and a politician--who merged at age forty-two to become the youngest President in history. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt begins at the apex of his international prestige. That was on New Year's Day, 1907, when TR, who had just won the Nobel Peace Prize, threw open the doors of the White House to the American people and shook 8,150 hands. One visitor remarked afterward, ""You go to the White House, you shake hands with Roosevelt and hear him talk--and then you go home to wring the personality out of your clothes.""  The rest of this book tells the story of TR's irresistible rise to power. During the years 1858-1901, Theodore Roosevelt transformed himself from a frail, asthmatic boy into a full-blooded man. Fresh out of Harvard, he simultaneously published a distinguished work of naval history and became the fist-swinging leader of a Republican insurgency in the New York State Assembly. He chased thieves across the Badlands of North Dakota with a copy of Anna Karenina in one hand and a Winchester rifle in the other. Married to his childhood sweetheart in 1886, he became the country squire of Sagamore Hill on Long Island, a flamboyant civil service reformer in Washington, D.C., and a night-stalking police commissioner in New York City. As assistant secretary of the navy, he almost single-handedly brought about the Spanish-American War. After leading ""Roosevelt's Rough Riders"" in the famous charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, he returned home a military hero, and was rewarded with the governorship of New York. In what he called his ""spare hours"" he fathered six children and wrote fourteen books. By 1901, the man Senator Mark Hanna called ""that damned cowboy"" was vice president. Seven months later, an assassin's bullet gave TR the national leadership he had always craved. His is a story so prodigal in its variety, so surprising in its turns of fate, that previous biographers have treated it as a series of haphazard episodes. This book, the only full study of TR's pre-presidential years, shows that he was an inevitable chief executive. ""It was as if he were subconsciously aware that he was a man of many selves,"" the author writes, ""and set about developing each one in turn, knowing that one day he would be President of all the people.""",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Edmund Morris\The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt (1244)\cover.jpg,9780375756788,2001-02-15T13:27:52+00:00,Modern Library,,,1.0,"Roosevelt, Biography & Autobiography, Biography, 20th century, New York (State) - Politics and government - 1865-1950, Government, Presidents - United States, New York (State), Theodore, History, Presidents & Heads of State, Historical, General, Presidents, United States - Politics and government - 1901-1909, United States, State & Provincial, Political Science",The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,1244
Edmund Morris,"Of all our great presidents, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one whose greatness increased out of office. When he toured Europe in 1910 as plain “Colonel Roosevelt,” he was hailed as the most famous man in the world. Crowned heads vied to put him up in their palaces. “If I see another king,” he joked, “I think I shall bite him.”  Had TR won his historic “Bull Moose” campaign in 1912 (when he outpolled the sitting president, William Howard Taft), he might have averted World War I, so great was his international influence. Had he not died in 1919, at the early age of sixty, he would unquestionably have been reelected to a third term in the White House and completed the work he began in 1901 of establishing the United States as a model democracy, militarily strong and socially just.  This biography by Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award–winning author ofThe Rise of Theodore RooseveltandTheodore Rex, is itself the completion of a trilogy sure to stand as definitive. Packed with more adventure, variety, drama, humor, and tragedy than a big novel, yet documented down to the smallest fact, it recounts the last decade of perhaps the most amazing life in American history. What other president has written forty books, hunted lions, founded a third political party, survived an assassin’s bullet, and explored an unknown river longer than the Rhine?  Colonel Rooseveltbegins with a prologue recounting what TR called his “journey into the Pleistocene”—a yearlong safari through East Africa, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian. Some readers will be repulsed by TR’s bloodlust, which this book does not prettify, yet there can be no denying that the Colonel passionately loved and understood every living thing that came his way: The text is rich in quotations from his marvelous nature writing.  Although TR intended to remain out of politics when he returned home in 1910, a fateful decision that spring drew him back into public life. By the end of the summer, in his famous “New Nationalism” speech, he was the guiding spirit of the Progressive movement, which inspired much of the social agenda of the future New Deal. (TR’s fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt acknowledged that debt, adding that the Colonel “was the greatest man I ever knew.”)  Then follows a detailed account of TR’s reluctant yet almost successful campaign for the White House in 1912. But unlike other biographers, Edmund Morris does not treat TR mainly as a politician. This volume gives as much consideration to TR’s literary achievements and epic expedition to Brazil in 1913–1914 as to his fatherhood of six astonishingly different children, his spiritual and aesthetic beliefs, and his eager embrace of other cultures—from Arab and Magyar to German and American Indian. It is impossible to readColonel Rooseveltand not be awed by the man’s universality. The Colonel himself remarked, “I have enjoyed life as much as any nine men I know.”  Morris does not hesitate, however, to show how pathologically TR turned upon those who inherited the power he craved—the hapless Taft, the adroit Woodrow Wilson. When Wilson declined to bring the United States into World War I in 1915 and 1916, the Colonel blasted him with some of the worst abuse ever uttered by a former chief executive. Yet even Wilson had to admit that behind the Rooseveltian will to rule lay a winning idealism and decency. “He is just like a big boy—there is a sweetness about him that you can’t resist.” That makes the story of TR’s last year, when the “boy” in him died, all the sadder in the telling: the conclusion of a life of Aristotelian grandeur.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Edmund Morris\Colonel Roosevelt (1245)\cover.jpg,9780375504877,2010-02-15T12:31:34+00:00,Random House,,,1.0,"Roosevelt, Biography & Autobiography, 20th century, Biography, Presidents - United States, United States - Politics and government - 1913-1921, Theodore, History, Presidents, Presidents & Heads of State, United States - Politics and government - 1909-1913, General, United States",Colonel Roosevelt,1245

There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one.In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates.

Doris Kearns Goodwin,"Winner of the Lincoln Prize Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.  Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.  It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.  We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.  This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Doris Kearns Goodwin\Team of Rivals_ The Political Geniu (1269)\cover.jpg,9780684824901,2005-10-25T14:36:39+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Presidents - United States, Psychology, General, Political Process, Leadership, Political, Presidents, Presidents & Heads of State, Political leadership, Executive Branch, Political leadership - United States, Biography, Case studies, Government, United States - Politics and government - 1861-1865, Génie (Aptitude), Historical, Civil War Period (1850-1877), Genius, Political Science, Leadership politique, États-Unis, Lincoln, Abraham, Présidents, History, American Government, Abraham - Friends and associates, United States",Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,1269

Denis Leary,"A hilarious blast of scathing irreverence from the award-winning actor and comedian.Â“A pissed off Leary is the best Leary,Â” says one critic of the writer and comic. In Why We Suck, Dr. Denis Leary uses his common sense, and his biting and hilarious take on the world, to attack the politically correct, the hypocritical, the obese, the thin--basically everyone who takes themselves too seriously. He does so with the extra oomph of a doctorate bestowed upon him by his alma mater Emerson College. Â“Sure itÂ&#39;s just a celebrity type of thing--they only gave it to me because IÂ&#39;m famous.Â” Leary explains. Â“But itÂ&#39;s legal and it means I get to say IÂ&#39;m a doctor--just like Dr. Phil.Â” In Why We Suck, LearyÂ&#39;s famously smart style and sardonic wit have found their fullest and fiercest expression yet. Zeroing in on the ridiculous wherever he finds it, Leary unravels his Irish Catholic upbringing, the folly of celebrity, the pressures of family life, and the great hypocrisy of politics with the same bright, savage, and profane insight he brought to his critically acclaimed one-man shows No Cure for Cancer and Lock Â&#39;n Load, and his platinum-selling song, Â“Asshole.Â” Proudly Irish American, defiantly working class, with a reserve of compassion for the underdog and the overlooked, Leary delivers blistering diatribes that are penetrating social commentary with no holds barred. LearyÂ&#39;s book will find wide appeal among people who want to laugh out loud or find a guide who matches their view of whatÂ&#39;s wrong in America and the world-at-large; and fans of his one-man shows, his many movies, and Rescue Me, LearyÂ&#39;s Golden Globe and EmmyÂ–nominated television show.

If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel,Velocitywould break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life.  Velocity  Bill Wile is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car.If you don’t take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours. It seems like a sick joke, and Bill’s friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it’s Bill’s fault: he didn’t convince the police to get involved.

Dean Koontz,"EDITORIAL REVIEW: Tommy Phan is a successful detective novelist, living the American Dream in southern California. One evening he comes home to find a small rag doll on his doorstep. It's a simple doll, covered entirely in white cloth, with crossed black stitches for the eyes and mouth, and another pair forming an X over the heart. Curious, he brings it inside. That night, Tommy hears an odd popping sound and looks up to see the stitches breaking over the doll's heart. And in minutes the fabric of Tommy Phan's reality will be torn apart.

What would you do for love? Would you die? Would you kill? We have your wife. You can get her back for two million cash. Landscaper Mitchell Rafferty thinks it must be some kind of joke.

Now he's standing in a normal suburban neighborhood on a bright summer day, having a phone conversation out of his darkest nightmare. Whoever is on the other end of the line is dead serious. He has Mitch's wife and he's named the price for her safe return. The caller doesn't care that Mitch runs a small two-man landscaping operation and has no way of raising such a vast sum. He's confident that Mitch will find a way. If he loves his wife enough. . . Mitch does love her enough. He loves her more than life itself. He's got seventy-two hours to prove it.

Bestselling novelist Cullen “Cubby” Greenwich is a lucky man and he knows it. He makes a handsome living doing what he enjoys. His wife, Penny, a children’s book author and illustrator, is the love of his life. Together they have a brilliant six-year-old, Milo, affectionately dubbed “Spooky,” and a non-collie named Lassie, who’s all but part of the family.  So Cubby knows he shouldn’t let one bad review of his otherwise triumphant new book get to him—even if it does appear in the nation’s premier newspaper and is penned by the much-feared, seldom-seen critic, Shearman Waxx. Cubby knows the best thing to do is ignore the gratuitously vicious, insulting, and inaccurate comments. Penny knows it, even little Milo knows it. If Lassie could talk, she’d tell Cubby to ignore them, too.  Ignore Shearman Waxx and his poison pen is just what Cubby intends to do. Until he happens to learn where the great man is taking his lunch. Cubby just wants to get a look at the mysterious recluse whose mere opinion can make or break a career—or a life.  But Shearman Waxx isn’t what Cubby expects; and neither is the escalating terror that follows what seemed to be an innocent encounter. For Waxx gives criticism; he doesn’t take it. He has ways of dealing with those who cross him that Cubby is only beginning to fathom. Soon Cubby finds himself in a desperate struggle with a relentless sociopath, facing an inexorable assault on far more than his life.

At the height of his powers as a literary craftsman, he has won the acclaim of critics as well as the allegiance of millions of fans the world over, transforming the greatest fears and hopes of our time into masterworks of dazzling originality and emotional resonance.  Now, with the stunning depth and virtuosity of his storytelling, he brings to readers one of his most gripping and richly imagined novels to date—an intoxicating story of adventure and suspense, mystery and revelation, told with humor, heart, and high art.  One Door Away From Heaven In a dusty trailer park on the far edge of the California dream, Michelina Bellsong contemplates the choices she has made. At twenty-eight, she wants to change the direction of her troubled life but can’t find her way—until a new family settles into the rental trailer next door and she meets the young girl who will lead her on a remarkable quest that will change Micky herself and everything she knows—or thinks she knows—forever.  Despite the brace she must wear on her deformed left leg, and her withered left hand, nine-year-old Leilani Klonk radiates a buoyant and indomitable spirit that inspires Micky. Beneath Leilani’s effervescence, however, Micky comes to sense a quiet desperation that the girl dares not express.  Leilani’s mother is little more than a child herself. And the girl’s stepfather, Preston Maddoc, is educated but threatening. He has moved the family from place to place as he fanatically investigates UFO sightings, striving to make contact, claiming to have had a vision that by Leilani’s tenth birthday aliens will either heal her or take her away to a better life on their world.  Slowly, ever more troubling details emerge in Leilani’s conversations with Micky. Most chilling is Micky’s discovery that Leilani had an older brother, also disabled, who vanished after Maddoc took him into the woods one night and is now “gone to the stars.”  Leilani’s tenth birthday is approaching. Micky is convinced the girl will be dead by that day. While the child-protection bureaucracy gives Micky the runaround, the Maddoc family slips away into the night. Micky sets out across America to track and find them, alone and afraid but for the first time living for something bigger than herself.  She finds herself pitted against an adversary, Preston Maddoc, as fearsome as he is cunning. The passion and disregard for danger with which Micky pursues her quest bring to her side a burned-out detective who joins her on a journey of incredible peril and startling discoveries, a journey through terrible darkness to unexpected light.  One Door Away From Heaven is an incandescent mix of suspense and humor, fear and wonder, a story of redemption and timeless wisdom that will have readers cheering. Filled with tragedy and joy, with terror and hope, it solidifies Dean Koontz’s reputation as one of the foremost storytellers of our time.

But they do try to communicate, with a short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, Stormy Llewellyn. Maybe he has a gift, maybe it's a curse, Odd has never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out. Sometimes they want justice, and Odd's otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one. But this time it's different.  A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite, a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants, not even Odd's deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15.  Today is August 14.  In less than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe. As evil coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll.

Chris's natural element is the night, and his parents, both academics, chose to live in Moonlight Bay because in a small town Chris can make the nightscape his own—roaming freely through the town on his bike, surfing in the moonlight, exploring while most people sleep.But Chris's brilliant mother, a scientist, was killed in a car accident 2 years ago, and as the book opens his father, Steven Snow, is dying of cancer; Chris's protected life is about to change forever. We meet Chris as he is carefully preparing himself to go out in the late-afternoon sun to visit the hospital. In his last moments of life his father tells Chris he is ""sorry"" and that Chris should ""fear nothing""—cryptic words that Chris cannot really relate to.Steven Snow's body is removed to the hospital basement for transport to the funeral home/crematorium, and when Chris goes downstairs for a final moment of farewell, he witnesses a frightening and clandestine encounter: the funeral director and another man Chris doesn't recognize are substituting the body of a hitchhiker for Steven Snow's body–which is being taken not to the crematorium but to some secret destination.For Chris, this scene is the first intimation of a conspiracy that he will come to realize envelopes many of his townspeople. His parents knew of it and wanted to protect Chris from it. His best friend has had hints of something wrong because of the frightening nocturnal visitors that have come to his beachhouse. And the first person to try to explain to Chris what's going on—and warn him about the special danger he himself is in—will be hideously murdered.In the 24 hours this book encompasses, Christopher Snow will find out that, sheltered though he's been, he has the soul of a fighter and an adventurer.

These functions are essential not only to our daily lives but to the evolution of the human race: without the ability to anticipate the future, mankind would never have crafted tools or invented agriculture.

David Stephen Mitchell,"By the New York Times bestselling author of The Bone Clocks - Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize A postmodern visionary and one of the leading voices in twenty-first-century fiction, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian love of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending, philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. In this groundbreaking novel, an influential favorite among a new generation of writers, Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity. Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . . Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history. But the story doesn't end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky. As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon. Praise for Cloud Atlas  ""[David] Mitchell is, clearly, a genius. He writes as though at the helm of some perpetual dream machine, can evidently do anything, and his ambition is written in magma across this novel's every page.""--The New York Times Book Review  ""One of those how-the-holy-hell-did-he-do-it? modern classics that no doubt is--and should be--read by any student of contemporary literature.""--Dave Eggers  ""Wildly entertaining . . . a head rush, both action-packed and chillingly ruminative.""--People  ""The novel as series of nested dolls or Chinese boxes, a puzzle-book, and yet--not just dazzling, amusing, or clever but heartbreaking and passionate, too.

David McCullough,"America’s beloved and distinguished historian presents, in a book of breathtaking excitement, drama, and narrative force, the stirring story of the year of our nation’s birth, 1776, interweaving, on both sides of the Atlantic, the actions and decisions that led Great Britain to undertake a war against her rebellious colonial subjects and that placed America’s survival in the hands of George Washington.In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence—when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.  Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King’s men, the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.  Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough’s 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\David McCullough\Seventeen Seventy-Six (1322)\cover.jpg,9780743226721,2006-07-04T14:31:19+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, War, United States - History - Revolution, History, Revolution, General, History - U.S., History - Military, 1775-1783, United States, Revolutionary Period (1775-1800), United States - General, Military, United States - Revolutionary War, History: American",Seventeen Seventy-Six,1322

David Foster Wallace,"A gargantuan, mind-altering comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\David Foster Wallace\Infinite Jest (1324)\cover.jpg,9780316066525,2006-11-13T12:58:12+00:00,"Little, Brown",,,1.0,"Fiction, General",Infinite Jest,1324

David Eddings,"Time was running out for Garion and his companions in their quest to recover Garion's infant son and heir. If they could not locate the Place Which Is No More, then Zandramas, the Child of Dark, would use Garion's son in a rite that would raise the Dark Prophecy to eternal dominion over the universe. Only the Seeress of Kell could reveal the site of that mysterious place - and that she could do only once Garion and Polgara had fulfilled an ancient prophecy in the mountain fastness of the Seers. Kell itself was closed to Zandramas - but her dark magic could force the knowledge she needed from one of Garion's party.

David Cross,"The star and creative force behind Mr. Show and Arrested Development pens his ""first and final book, chronicling his meteoric rise and abysmal fall in the literary world.""  After a decade spent in isolation in the Ugandan jungles thinking about stuff, David Cross has written his first book. Known for roles on the small screen such as ""never-nude"" Tobias Funke on Arrested Development and the role of ""David"" in Mr. Show With Bob And David, as well as a hugely successful stand-up routine full of sharp-tongued rants and rages, Cross has carved out his place in American comedy. Whether deflating the pomposity of religious figures, calling out the pathetic symbiosis of pseudo-celebrity and its leaching fandom, or merely pushing the buttons of the way-too-easily offended P.C. left or the caustic, double-standard of the callous (but funnier) right, Cross has something to say about everyone, including his own ridiculous self.Now, for the first time, Cross is weaving his media mockery, celebrity denunciation, religious commentary and sheer madness into book form, revealing the true story behind his almost existential distaste of Jim Belushi (""The Belush""), disclosing the up-to-now unpublished minutes to a meeting of Fox television network executives, and offering up a brutally grotesque run-in with Bill O'Reilly. And as if this wasn't enough for your laughing pleasure in these troubled times, some of the pieces splinter off with additional material being created online in exclusive video and animated web content created solely for the book-a historical first (presumably)!With a mix of personal essays, satirical fiction posing as truth, advice for rich people, information from America's least favorite Rabbi and a top-ten list of top-ten lists, I Drink for a Reason is as unique as the comedian himself, and cannot be missed.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\David Cross\I Drink for a Reason (1338)\cover.jpg,9780446550888,2009-08-31T13:56:16+01:00,Grand Central Publishing,,,1.0,"American wit and humor, Humor, Essays, American Satire And Humor, General, Form - Essays, Form",I Drink for a Reason,1338

Dave Cullen,"On April 20, 1999, two boys left an indelible stamp on the American psyche. Their goal was simple: to blow up their school, Oklahoma-City style, and to leave ""a lasting impression on the world."" Their bombs failed, but the ensuing shooting defined a new era of school violence-irrevocably branding every subsequent shooting ""another Columbine."" When we think of Columbine, we think of the Trench Coat Mafia; we think of Cassie Bernall, the girl we thought professed her faith before she was shot; and we think of the boy pulling himself out of a school window -- the whole world was watching him. Now, in a riveting piece of journalism nearly ten years in the making, comes the story none of us knew. In this revelatory book, Dave Cullen has delivered a profile of teenage killers that goes to the heart of psychopathology. He lays bare the callous brutality of mastermind Eric Harris, and the quavering, suicidal Dylan Klebold, who went to prom three days earlier and obsessed about love in his journal.  The result is an astonishing account of two good students with lots of friends, who came to stockpile a basement cache of weapons, to record their raging hatred, and to manipulate every adult who got in their way. They left signs everywhere, described by Cullen with a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, thousands of pages of police files, FBI psychologists, and the boy's tapes and diaries, he gives the first complete account of the Columbine tragedy. In the tradition of HELTER SKELTER and IN COLD BLOOD, COLUMBINE is destined to be a classic. A close-up portrait of hatred, a community rendered helpless, and the police blunders and cover-ups, it is a compelling and utterly human portrait of two killers-an unforgettable cautionary tale for our times.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Dave Cullen\Columbine (1343)\cover.jpg,9780446546935,2009-04-06T13:31:44+01:00,Grand Central Publishing,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, School shootings - Colorado - Littleton, 20th century, United States - 20th Century (1945 to 2000), General, True Crime, Educational Policy & Reform, Colo., School Safety & Violence, School Health And Safety, Modern, Education, United States - State & Local - West, Murder, Colo.), Murder - General, Violence in Society, Littleton, Educational Policy & Reform - School Safety, West, School Safety, Criminals & Outlaws, Columbine High School Massacre, History, History - U.S., Columbine High School (Littleton, Colorado, United States, School shootings, 1999, State & Local, Social Science, Violence (Sociological Aspects)",Columbine,1343

Dan Simmons,"In ""The Rise of Endymion, "" Dan Simmons brings to a triumphant conclusion one of the most celebrated, compelling, and dramatic science fiction sagas of our time. Brilliant, provocative, unfailingly inventive, the odyssey began with the Hugo Award{winning ""Hyperion, "" continued through the critically acclaimed ""The Fall of Hyperion"" and ""Endymion, "" and now ascends to its greatest heights yet....The final chapter of this magnificent saga begins with two momentous events: the death and resurrection of Pope Julius XV and the coming-of-age of the new messiah. Her name is Aenea and she is the only person who can counter the pope and his plan to unleash the Pax Fleet, the Church's military wing, on a final genocidal Crusade to gain total dominion over the universe. The Church is allied with the infamous AI Core, which has offered immortality to humankind--or at least to those faithful who pledge total obedience to the Church--but at what terrible price? The Core has its own dark motives and secrets, and only Aenea knows what they are.Aenea, too, has an ally. Her protector, Raul Endymion, onetime shepherd and convicted murderer, finds her in exile undergoing a strange apprenticeship on Old Earth. Here she has gained access to an information matrix created by the Others--the same mysterious Others who moved Old Earth to save it from the Core. But who are these Others? What has Aenea learned from them? And why has Old Earth been turned into a stage upon which cybrids from the past--from John Keats to Frank Lloyd Wright--repeat historical dramas of human genius for purposes known only to the Others?The answers to these questions must wait. Together with the android A. Bettik,Endymion and his beloved Aenea embark on a final mission to find and comprehend the underlying fabric of the universe. The surprising nature of this medium and Aenea's ability to instruct her growing army of disciples in its discovery and use could provide the one weapon powerful enough to thwart their enemies while liberating humanity. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Shrike--monster, angel, killing machine--has followed them on their intergalactic sojourn and now stands ready to complete its own mission, revealing at last the long-held secret of its origin and purpose.In ""The Rise of Endymion, "" Dan Simmons masterfully weaves together the complex strands of this extraordinary series.

Dan Simmons,"On June 9, 1865, while traveling by train to London with his secret mistress, 53-year-old Charles Dickens -- at the height of his powers and popularity, the most famous and successful novelist in the world and perhaps in the history of the world -- hurtled into a disaster that changed his life forever.  Did Dickens begin living a dark double life after the accident? Were his nightly forays into the worst slums of London and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying?  Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), Drood explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author's last years and may provide the key to Dickens's final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood.

Lawrence, is part of theBarnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:   New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate  All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. Called the most widely-read English novel of the twentieth century, D. H. Lawrence''s largely autobiographical Sons and Lovers tells the story of Paul Morel, a young artist growing into manhood in a British working-class community near the Nottingham coalfields. His mother Gertrude, unhappily married to Paul''s hard-drinking father, devotes all her energies to her son. They develop a powerful and passionate relationship, but eventually tensions arise when Paul falls in love with a girl and seeks to escape his family ties. Torn between his desire for independence and his abiding attachment to his loving but overbearing mother, Paul struggles to define himself sexually and emotionally through his relationships with two women--the innocent, old-fashioned Miriam Leivers, and the experienced, provocatively modern Clara Dawes. Heralding Lawrence''s mature period, Sons and Lovers vividly evokes the all-consuming nature of possessive love and sexual attraction. Lushly descriptive and deeply emotional, it is rich in universal truths about human relationships. Victoria Blake is a freelance writer.

Along the way he stumbles through several attempts to make his mark—as a punk rock musician, a construction worker, a bouncer, and, tragically, a modern dancer.   To numb the pain of failure, Ferguson found comfort in drugs and alcohol, addictions that eventually led to an aborted suicide attempt. (He forgot to do it when someone offered him a glass of sherry.) But his story has a happy ending: in 1993, the washed-up Ferguson washed up in the United States. Finally sober, Ferguson landed a breakthrough part on the hit sitcom The Drew Carey Show, a success that eventually led to his role as the host of CBS's The Late Late Show. By far Ferguson's greatest triumph was his decision to become a U.S. citizen, a milestone he achieved in early 2008, just before his command performance for the president at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. In American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white, and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Craig Ferguson\American on Purpose_ The Improbable (1370)\cover.jpg,9780061719547,2009-09-22T13:15:05+01:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Actors - United States, Films, Personal Memoirs, General, cinema, Comedians, Comedians - Scotland, Entertainment & Performing Arts - Television Personalities, Television personalities - United States, Entertainment & Performing Arts - General, Entertainment & Performing Arts, Ferguson, Television Plays And Programs, Biography, Anthropology, Actors, Television personalities, Scottish Americans, Autobiography: arts & entertainment, Cultural, USA, Autobiography, Scots, Craig, Autobiography: The Arts, United States, Comedians - United States, Social Science",American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot,1370

Emma Cornwall,"In the steampunk world of Victorian London, a beautiful vampire seeks out the author of Dracula–to set the record straight . . . If one is to believe Bram Stoker’s legendary vampire tale, Lucy Weston is Dracula’s most wanton creation, a sexual creature of the night who preys on innocent boys. But the real-life Lucy is nothing like her fictional counterpart—and she demands to know why the Victorian author deliberately lied. With Stoker’s reluctant help, she’s determined to track down the very fiend who transformed her—from the sensual underworld where humans vie to become vampires, to a hidden cell beneath a temple to madness, and finally into the glittering Crystal Palace where death reigns supreme. Haunted by fragmentary memories of her lost life and love, Lucy must battle her thirst for blood as she struggles to stop a catastrophic war that will doom vampires and humans alike. Ultimately, she must make a choice that illuminates for her—and for us—what it means to be human.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Emma Cornwall\Incarnation (1376)\cover.jpg,9781439190401,2012-09-18T13:57:52+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Fiction, Fantasy, paranormal, Historical, General",Incarnation,1376

Cormac McCarthy,"A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.  A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.  The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Cormac McCarthy\The Road (1380)\cover.jpg,9780307265432,2006-02-15T13:43:41+00:00,Alfred A.

That’s how it works for most celebrities: After they croak, their circle of friends just explodes.…”  Rant is the mind-bending new novel from Chuck Palahniuk, the literary provocateur responsible for such books as the generation-defining classic Fight Club and the pedal-to-the-metal horrorfest Haunted. It takes the form of an oral history of one Buster “Rant” Casey, who may or may not be the most efficient serial killer of our time.   “What ‘Typhoid Mary’ Mallon was to typhoid, what Gaetan Dugas was to AIDS, and Liu Jian-lun was to SARS, Buster Casey would become for rabies.”  A high school rebel who always wins (and a childhood murderer?), Rant Casey escapes from his small hometown of Middleton for the big city. He becomes the leader of an urban demolition derby called Party Crashing. On appointed nights participants recognize one another by such designated car markings as “Just Married” toothpaste graffiti and then stalk and crash into each other. Rant Casey will die a spectacular highway death, after which his friends gather testimony needed to build an oral history of his short, violent life. Their collected anecdotes explore the possibility that his saliva caused a silent urban plague of rabies and that he found a way to escape the prison house of linear time.…   “The future you have, tomorrow, won’t be the same future you had, yesterday.” —Rant Casey  Expect hilarity, horror, and blazing insight into the desperate and surreal contemporary human condition as only Chuck Palahniuk can deliver it. He's the postmillennial Jonathan Swift, the visionary to watch to learn what's —uh-oh—coming next.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Chuck Palahniuk\Rant_ An Oral Biography of Buster C (1396)\cover.jpg,9780385517874,2007-02-15T13:25:26+00:00,Doubleday,,,1.0,"Juvenile Fiction, Fiction, General, Popular American Fiction, Fiction - General, Psychological, Horror & Ghost Stories",Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey,1396

Chuck Palahniuk,"From the author of the ""New York Times bestseller ""Choke and the cult classic ""Fight Club, a cunningly plotted novel about the ultimate verbal weapon, one that reinvents the apocalyptic thriller for our times. Carl Streator is a solitary widower and a fortyish newspaper reporter who is assigned to do a series of articles on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In the course of this investigation he discovers an ominous thread: the presence at the death scenes of the anthology ""Poems and Rhymes Around the World, all opened to the page where there appears an African chant, or ""culling song."" This song turns out to be lethal when spoken or even ""thought in anyone's direction-and once it lodges in Streator's brain he finds himself becoming an involuntary serial killer. So he teams up with a real estate broker, one Helen Hoover Boyle-who specializes in selling haunted (or ""distressed"") houses (wonderfully high turnover), and who lost a child to the culling song years before-for a cross-country odyssey to remove all copies of the book from libraries, lest this deadly verbal virus spread and wipe out human life. Accompanying them on this road trip are Helen's assistant, Mona Sabbat, an exquisitely earnest Wiccan, and her sardonic ecoterrorist boyfriend Oyster, who is running a scam involving fake liability claims and business blackmail. Welcome to the new nuclear family. On one level, ""Lullaby is a chillingly pertinent parable about the dangers of psychic infection and control in an era of wildly overproliferated information: ""Imagine a plague you catch through your ears . . . imagine an idea that occupies your mind like a city.""

Chuck Palahniuk,"Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk is a novel made up of stories: Twenty-three of them, to be precise. Twenty-three of the most horrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you’ll ever encounter—sometimes all at once. They are told by people who have answered an ad headlined “Writers’ Retreat: Abandon Your Life for Three Months,” and who are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of “real life” that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them. But “here” turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world—and where heat and power and, most important, food are in increasingly short supply. And the more desperate the circumstances become, the more extreme the stories they tell—and the more devious their machinations become to make themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/nonfiction blockbuster that will surely be made from their plight.Haunted is on one level a satire of reality television—The Real World meets Alive. It draws from a great literary tradition—The Canterbury Tales, The Decameron, the English storytellers in the Villa Diodati who produced, among other works, Frankenstein—to tell an utterly contemporary tale of people desperate that their story be told at any cost.

Chuck Palahniuk,"With more than 300,000 copies sold, Chuck Palahniuk's brilliant first novel and cult classic is being reissued with a new Introduction by the author  An underground classic since its first publication in 1996, Fight Club is widely recognized as one of the most original and provocative novels of the last decade. Now the author adds his own voice to the critical debate he generated. In a new Introduction, he discusses the various interpretations in the popular media of Fight Club and the movie it inspired, as well as his personal reactions to the work's reception and the influence that the Fight Club phenomenon has already had on our culture.  Chuck Palahniuk's darkly funny first novel tells the story of a disenfranchised young man frustrated with his bureacratic job and superficial relationships and disillusioned with the consumer culture's prepackaged pleasures. Relief for him and his peers comes in the form of Tyler Durden, the intensely charismatic inventor of Fight Club. Waiters, clerks, and middlemen seek out the visceral satisfaction of secret after-hours boxing matches in the basements of bars, thinking they have found a way to live beyond their confining and stultifying lives.

I’ve heard there’s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don’t laugh when they’re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about Rear Window and college football and Mad Men and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there’s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I’m misinformed. Q: Is there a larger theme? A: Oh, something about reality. ""What is reality,"" maybe? No, that’s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga. Q: Should I read this book? A: Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana’s In Utero? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don’t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book.

Amber Benson & Christopher Golden,"Legends say that on stormy nights, or during sunsets, there sometimes comes a strange whistling in the sky followed by sightings of enormous black dogs. But these are no ordinary dogs. They are demonic things, hounds loose from the Wild Hunt, and they are searching for lost souls. They are rarely sighted more than one at a time, but if all seven should come together, it will mean the end of the world. In the picturesque New England town of Kingsbury, Vermont, a young woman named Rose Kerrigan mourns the death of her grandfather, the sweet but strange old man who raised her. Soon, Rose will learn the legend of the Seven Whistlers. They've come to Kingsbury in search of a soul that has been hidden from them, and they will not leave without it. First there was one, then two...then four...If they don't find what they're looking for soon, perhaps all seven will gather in Kingsbury. And if all seven should come together....Praise for The Seven Whistlers - ""A quick, intriguing, satisfyingly creepy read, refreshingly free of emo sap. Fans of dark, post-modern fantasy should find it to be a tasty morsel.""-- The Green Man Review""Powerful, beautifully conceived and developed, and utterly riveting. Benson and Golden have created a new mythology that rings true.

China Miéville,"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, THE SEATTLE TIMES, AND PUBLISHERS WEEKLY.   When a murdered woman is found in the city of Beszel, somewhere at the edge of Europe, it looks to be a routine case for Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad. To investigate, Borlú must travel from the decaying Beszel to its equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the vibrant city of Ul Qoma. But this is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a seeing of the unseen. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, Borlú is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman’s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.BONUS: This edition contains a The City & The City discussion guide and excerpts from China Miéville's Kraken and Embassytown.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\China Mieville\The City & the City_ A Novel (1420)\cover.jpg,9780345515667,2009-05-26T14:39:17+01:00,Random House Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Fiction, Fantasy, Action & Adventure, Mystery & Detective, Traditional, Literary",The City & the City: A Novel,1420
China Miéville,"A mythmaker of the highest order, China Miéville has emblazoned the fantasy novel with fresh language, startling images, and stunning originality. Set in the same sprawling world of Miéville’s Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning novel,Perdido Street Station, this latest epic introduces a whole new cast of intriguing characters and dazzling creations.  Aboard a vast seafaring vessel, a band of prisoners and slaves, their bodies remade into grotesque biological oddities, is being transported to the fledgling colony of New Crobuzon. But the journey is not theirs alone. They are joined by a handful of travelers, each with a reason for fleeing the city. Among them is Bellis Coldwine, a renowned linguist whose services as an interpreter grant her passage—and escape from horrific punishment. For she is linked to Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin, the brilliant renegade scientist who has unwittingly unleashed a nightmare upon New Crobuzon.  For Bellis, the plan is clear: live among the new frontiersmen of the colony until it is safe to return home. But when the ship is besieged by pirates on the Swollen Ocean, the senior officers are summarily executed. The surviving passengers are brought to Armada, a city constructed from the hulls of pirated ships, a floating, landless mass ruled by the bizarre duality called the Lovers. On Armada, everyone is given work, and even Remades live as equals to humans, Cactae, and Cray. Yet no one may ever leave.  Lonely and embittered in her captivity, Bellis knows that to show dissent is a death sentence. Instead, she must furtively seek information about Armada’s agenda. The answer lies in the dark, amorphous shapes that float undetected miles below the waters—terrifying entities with a singular, chilling mission. . . .

China Miéville,"A magnificent fantasy rife with scientific splendor, magical intrigue, and wonderfully realized characters, told in a storytelling style in which Charles Dickens meets Neal Stephenson, Perdido Street Station offers an eerie, voluptuously crafted world that will plumb the depths of every reader's imagination.  Beneath the towering bleached ribs of a dead, ancient beast lies New Crobuzon, a squalid city where humans, Re-mades, and arcane races live in perpetual fear of Parliament and its brutal militia. The air and rivers are thick with factory pollutants and the strange effluents of alchemy, and the ghettos contain a vast mix of workers, artists, spies, junkies, and whores. In New Crobuzon, the unsavory deal is stranger to none—not even to Isaac, a brilliant scientist with a penchant for Crisis Theory. Isaac has spent a lifetime quietly carrying out his unique research. But when a half-bird, half-human creature known as the Garuda comes to him from afar, Isaac is faced with challenges he has never before fathomed. Though the Garuda's request is scientifically daunting, Isaac is sparked by his own curiosity and an uncanny reverence for this curious stranger. While Isaac's experiments for the Garuda turn into an obsession, one of his lab specimens demands attention: a brilliantly colored caterpillar that feeds on nothing but a hallucinatory drug and grows larger—and more consuming—by the day. What finally emerges from the silken cocoon will permeate every fiber of New Crobuzon—and not even the Ambassador of Hell will challenge the malignant terror it invokes . . .BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from China Mieville’s Embassytown.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\China Mieville\Perdido Street Station (1422)\cover.jpg,9780345464521,2003-07-29T14:20:28+01:00,Random House Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Steampunk fiction, Fiction, Science fiction, Steampunk, Dissenters, General, Action & Adventure, Adventure, Strangers, Alienation (Social psychology), Fantasy",Perdido Street Station,1422

Cherie Priest,"Rector ""Wreck ‘em"" Sherman was orphaned as a toddler in the Blight of 1863, but that was years ago. Wreck has grown up, and on his eighteenth birthday, he'll be cast out out of the orphanage. And Wreck's problems aren't merelyabout finding a home. He's been quietly breaking the cardinal rule of any good drug dealer and dipping into his own supply of the sap he sells. He's also pretty sure he's being haunted by the ghost of a kid he used to know—Zeke Wilkes, who almost certainly died six months ago. Zeke would have every reason to pester Wreck, since Wreck got him inside the walled city of Seattle in the first place, and that was probably what killed him.Maybe it's only a guilty conscience, but Wreck can't take it anymore, so he sneaks over the wall.The walled-off wasteland of Seattle is every bit as bad as he'd heard, chock-full of the hungry undead and utterly choked by the poisonous, inescapable yellow gas. And then there's the monster. Rector's pretty certain that whatever attacked him was not at all human—and not a rotter, either. Arms far too long. Posture all strange. Eyes all wild and faintly glowing gold and known to the locals as simpley ""The Inexplicables.""In the process of tracking down these creatures, Rector comes across another incursion through the wall—just as bizarre but entirely attributable to human greed.

Now, Ezekiel is determined to clear his father’s name, risking death and the undead in the attempt. Sixteen years ago, as the American Civil War dawned, gold brought hordes to the frozen Klondike.

Chelsea Handler,"In this raucous collection of true-life stories, actress and comedian Chelsea Handler recounts her time spent in the social trenches with that wild, strange, irresistible, and often gratifying beast: the one-night stand.You&#39;ve either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend&#39;s irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool.Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details.

But when a plague of sleeplessness attacks Los Angeles and the world beyond, his philosophical certainties are tested to destruction.

And after burning all his bridges, the only one left to cross leads to the Bronx, where Joe’s brass knuckles and straight razor can’t keep him from running afoul of a sadistic old bloodsucker with a bad bark and a worse bite. Even if every Clan in Manhattan is hollering for Joe’s head on a stick, it’s got to be better than trying to survive in the outer-borough wilderness.  So it’s a no-brainer when Clan boss Dexter Predo comes looking to make a deal. All Joe has to do to win back breathing privileges on his old turf is infiltrate an upstart Clan whose plan to cure the Vyrus could expose the secret Vampyre world to mortal eyes and set off a panic-driven massacre. Not cool. But Joe’s all over it. To save the Undead future, he just has to wade neck-deep through all the archenemies, former friends, and assorted heavy hitters he’s crossed in the past. No sweat? Maybe not, but definitely more blood than he’s ever seen or hungered for. And maybe even some tears–over the horror and heartbreaking truth about the evil men do no matter who or what they are.  Praise for Charlie Huston and his Joe Pitt novels  “In conceiving his world (a New York City divided by vampire clans, each with different reasons to hate Pitt), Huston gives a fading genre a fresh afterlife. [Grade:] A.” –Entertainment Weekly  “[Huston] creates a world that is at once supernatural and totally familiar, imaginative, and utterly convincing.” –The Philadelphia Inquirer",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Charlie Huston\Every Last Drop (1435)\cover.jpg,9780345495884,2008-02-15T13:00:44+00:00,Random House Publishing Group,,,1.0,"Fiction, Mystery & Detective, General, Hard-Boiled, Thrillers",Every Last Drop,1435

Charlie Huston,"**“[A] fantastically hopped-up thriller . . . a wrong-man plot worthy of Hitchcock.”— *Entertainment Weekly* (Editor’s Choice)**
It’s three thousand miles from the green fields of glory, where Henry “call me Hank” Thompson once played California baseball, to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where the tenements are old, the rents are high, and the drunks are dirty. But now Hank is here, working as a bartender and taking care of a cat named Bud who is surely going to get him killed. 
It begins when Hank’s neighbor, Russ, has to leave town in a rush and hands over Bud in a carrier. But it isn’t until two Russians in tracksuits drag Hank over the bar at the joint where he works and beat him to a pulp that he starts to get the idea: Someone wants something from him. He just doesn’t know what it is, where it is, or how to make them understand he doesn’t have it. 
Within twenty-four hours Hank is running over rooftops, swinging his old aluminum bat for the sweet spot of a guy’s head, playing hide and seek with the NYPD, riding the subway with a dead man at his side, and counting a whole lot of cash on a concrete floor. 
All because of two cowboys, two Russian mafia men, and some of the weirdest goons ever assembled in one place. All because of Bud. All because once, in another life, in another world, the only thing Hank wanted was to take third base—without getting caught. **

Charles Yu,"“A compulsively readable collection” of short fiction from the author of How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe (Publishers Weekly). With deadpan humor and originality, Charles Yu spins Kafkaesque tales of modern identity and insecurity in this whip-smart debut. In 401(k), a couple living in the Luxury Car Commercial subdivision are disappointed when their exotic vacation turns into a Life Insurance/Asset Management pitch. The author struggles to write the definitive biography of his mother in Autobiographical Raw Material Unsuitable for the Mining of Fiction. And would-be superhero Moisture Man must come to terms with the darkness in his heart.   Throughout the collection, Yu’s characters run up against the limitations of their artificial story lines while tackling the terrifying aspects of existence: mothers, jobs, spouses, and perhaps most terrifying of all, the need to express feelings. Heartbreaking and hilarious, Third Class Superhero marked the debut of an author who has been a PEN award finalist, and whose novel How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe was named one of Time’s best books of the year.   “The post-collegiate braininess of many of Yu’s stories is like the music of the Talking Heads, making the familiar seem off-kilter. . . .

Charles Darwin,"Introduction by Edward J. Larson   ﻿Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific inquiry, The Origin of Species sold out its first printing on the very day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England and, as the Saturday Review noted, the uproar over the book quickly “passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street.” Based largely on Darwin’s experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H. M. S. Beagle, The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species.

Carlos Ruiz Zafón,"Barcelona, 1945--just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.  As with all astounding novels, The Shadow of the Wind sends the mind groping for comparisons --The Crimson Petal and the White? The novels of Arturo Pérez-Reverte? Of Victor Hugo? Love in the Time of Cholera?--but in the end, as with all astounding novels, no comparison can suffice. As one leading Spanish reviewer wrote, ""The originality of Ruiz Zafón's voice is bombproof and displays a diabolical talent. The Shadow of the Wind announces a phenomenon in Spanish literature."" An uncannily absorbing historical mystery, a heart-piercing romance, and a moving homage to the mystical power of books, The Shadow of the Wind is a triumph of the storyteller's art.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Carlos Ruiz Zafon\The Shadow of the Wind (1463)\cover.jpg,9781594200106,2004-02-15T13:43:59+00:00,Penguin Press,,,1.0,"Suspense, Fiction, Spain, Antiquarian booksellers, Rare books, Books, Historical, General, Rare books - Spain - Barcelona, Young men, Literary, Barcelona, Barcelona (Spain), Widowers, Antiquarian booksellers - Spain - Barcelona, Mothers and sons",The Shadow of the Wind,1463

Carlo Rovelli,"'A dazzling book ... the new Stephen Hawking' Sunday TimesThe bestselling author of Seven Brief Lessons on Physics takes us on an enchanting, consoling journey to discover the meaning of time'We are time. We are this space, this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come.'Time is a mystery that does not cease to puzzle us. Philosophers, artists and poets have long explored its meaning while scientists have found that its structure is different from the simple intuition we have of it. From Boltzmann to quantum theory, from Einstein to loop quantum gravity, our understanding of time has been undergoing radical transformations. Time flows at a different speed in different places, the past and the future differ far less than we might think, and the very notion of the present evaporates in the vast universe.With his extraordinary charm and sense of wonder, bringing together science, philosophy and art, Carlo Rovelli unravels this mystery. Enlightening and consoling, The Order of Time shows that to understand ourselves we need to reflect on time -- and to understand time we need to reflect on ourselves.Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Carlo Rovelli\The Order of Time (1466)\cover.jpg,9780241292532,2018-04-26T14:43:05+01:00,Penguin UK,,,1.0,"Science, Physics, General, Time, Philosophy, Mind & Body, Astronomy, Body; Mind & Spirit",The Order of Time,1466

Do time and space exist? And what exactly is reality? Theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli has spent his life exploring these questions. He tells us how our understanding of reality has changed over the centuries and how physicists think about the structure of the universe today. In elegant and accessible prose, Rovelli takes us on a wondrous journey from Democritus to Albert Einstein, from Michael Faraday to gravitational waves, and from classical physics to his own work in quantum gravity. As he shows us how the idea of reality has evolved over time, Rovelli offers deeper explanations of the theories he introduced so concisely in Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. This book culminates in a lucid overview of quantum gravity, the field of research that explores the quantum nature of space and time, seeking to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Rovelli invites us to imagine a marvelous world where space breaks up into tiny grains, time disappears at the smallest scales, and black holes are waiting to explode—a vast universe still largely undiscovered.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Carlo Rovelli\Reality Is Not What It Seems_ The J (1467)\cover.jpg,9780735213944,2017-01-24T13:26:00+00:00,Penguin,,,1.0,"Science, Physics, General, Quantum Theory, Gravity",Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity,1467
Carl Sagan & Ann Druyan,"A prescient warning of a future we now inhabit, where fake news stories and Internet conspiracy theories play to a disaffected American populace  ""A glorious book . . . A spirited defense of science . . . From the first page to the last, this book is a manifesto for clear thought.""--Los Angeles Times  How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.  Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.

Now in this stunning sequel, Carl Sagan completes his revolutionary journey through space and time.

In Pale Blue Dot Sagan traces the spellbinding history of our launch into the cosmos and assesses the future that looms before us as we move out into our own solar system and on to distant galaxies beyond.

Dalton,Â” a professor of racialist studies and a leading authority on inferior people of all ethnicities, genders, religions, and sexual preferences. In the grand tradition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Birth of a Nation, he is on a mission to clarify the truth about self-supremacy, drawing on eminent scholarship to enlighten a new generation of hate-mongers. Presenting evidence that everyone should be hated (even white people), A Practical Guide to Racism contains sparkling bits of wisdom on such subjects as: Â• The good life enjoyed by blacks, who shuffle through life unhindered by the white manÂ's burdens, such as reverse racism and white slavery, to become accomplished athletes, rhymesmiths, and dominoes champions.

Bruce Campbell,"Okay, so at least you're interested enough to pick up this book and look inside. I think you and I are going to get along just fine. Life is full of choices. Right now, yours is whether or not to buy the autobiography of a mid-grade, kind of hammy actor. Am I supposed to know this guy? you think to yourself.No, and that's exactly the point. Bookstores are chock full of household name actors and their high stakes shenanigans. I don't want to be a spoilsport, but we've all been down that road before. Case in point: look to your left - see that Judy Garland book? You don't need that, you know plenty about her already - great voice, crappy life. Now look to your right at the Charlton Heston book. You don't need to cough up hard-earned dough for that either. You know his story too - great voice, crappy toupee. The truth is that though you might not have a clue who I am, there are countless working stiffs like me out there, grinding away every day at the wheel of fortune.If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor is my first book, and I invite you to ride with me through the choppy waters of blue collar Hollywood.

Brian Greene,"""[Greene] develops one fresh new insight after another...In the great tradition of physicists writing for the masses, The Elegant Universe sets a standard that will be hard to beat."" --George Johnson, The New York Times Book ReviewIn a rare blend of scientific insight and writing as elegant as the theories it explains, Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of 11 dimensions where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter-from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas-is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.Green uses everything from an amusement park ride to ants on a garden hose to illustrate the beautiful yet bizarre realities that modern physics is unveiling. Dazzling in its brilliance, unprecedented in its ability to both illuminate and entertain, The Elegant Universe is a tour de force of science writing-a delightful, lucid voyage through modern physics that brings us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Brian Greene\The Elegant Universe_ Superstrings, (1486)\cover.jpg",9780375708114,2000-02-15T13:39:54+00:00,Vintage Books,,,1.0,"Mathematics, Mathematical Physics, Science, Astronomy, Superstring theories, General, Physics, Cosmology, Astronomy - Universe, String Theory","The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory",1486
Bret Easton Ellis,"‘One of the most disturbing novels I’ve read in a long time. It possesses an unnerving air of documentary reality’ Michiko Kakutani, New York Times     In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with his debut novel, Less Than Zero. Published when he was just twenty-one, this extraordinary and instantly infamous work has done more than simply define a genre, it has become a rare thing: a cult classic and a timeless embodiment of the zeitgeist. Twenty-five years on, Less Than Zero continues to be a landmark in the lives of successive generations of readers across the globe.     Filled with relentless drinking in seamy bars and glamorous nightclubs, wild, drug-fuelled parties, and dispassionate sexual encounters, Less Than Zero – narrated by Clay, an eighteen-year-old student returning home to Los Angeles for Christmas – is a fierce coming-of-age story, justifiably celebrated for its unflinching depiction of hedonistic youth, its brutal portrayal of the inexorable consequences of such moral depravity, and its author’s refusal to condone or chastise such behaviour.     ‘An extraordinarily accomplished first novel’ New Yorker   ‘The Catcher in the Rye for the MTV generation’ USA Today   ‘Remarkable.

Its grasses can cut your arms and legs to ribbons, the rinds of its precious fruit can skewer your thumbs, and some of the predators are bigger than humans. Meteors fall from the sky and volcanoes erupt. Fremont is verdant, rich, beautiful, and dangerous. Fremont's single town, Artistos, perches on a cliff below rugged mountains. Below Artistos lie the Grass Plains, which lead down to the sea. And in the middle of the Grass Plains, a single silver spaceship lies quiet and motionless. The seasons do not dull it, nor do the winds scratch it---and the fearful citizens of Aristos won't go near it. Chelo Lee, her brother Joseph, and four other young children have been abandoned on the colony planet. Unfortunate events have left them orphaned in a human colony that abhors genetic engineering--and these six young people are genetically enhanced.

Brandon Sanderson,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight ArchiveThe Way of KingsWords of RadianceEdgedancer (Novella)Oathbringer The Mistborn trilogyMistborn: The Final EmpireThe Well of AscensionThe Hero of AgesMistborn: The Wax and Wayne seriesAlloy of LawShadows of SelfBands of MourningCollectionArcanum UnboundedOther Cosmere novelsElantrisWarbreakerThe Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians seriesAlcatraz vs. the Evil LibrariansThe Scrivener's BonesThe Knights of CrystalliaThe Shattered LensThe Dark TalentThe Rithmatist seriesThe RithmatistOther books by Brandon SandersonThe ReckonersSteelheartFirefightCalamityAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Brandon Sanderson\The Way of Kings_ Book One of the S (1500)\cover.jpg,9781429992800,2010-08-31T14:52:26+01:00,Tom Doherty Associates,,,1.0,"Fiction, Fantasy, Epic, Military, Action & Adventure",The Way of Kings: Book One of the Stormlight Archive,1500

The Lord Ruler -- the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years -- has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies – one of them composed of ferocious giants – now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope.

For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the ""Sliver of Infinity,"" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier ""snapped"" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight ArchiveThe Way of KingsWords of RadianceEdgedancer (Novella)Oathbringer The Mistborn trilogyMistborn: The Final EmpireThe Well of AscensionThe Hero of AgesMistborn: The Wax and Wayne seriesAlloy of LawShadows of SelfBands of MourningCollectionArcanum UnboundedOther Cosmere novelsElantrisWarbreakerThe Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians seriesAlcatraz vs. the Evil LibrariansThe Scrivener's BonesThe Knights of CrystalliaThe Shattered LensThe Dark TalentThe Rithmatist seriesThe RithmatistOther books by Brandon SandersonThe ReckonersSteelheartFirefightCalamity",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Brandon Sanderson\Mistborn_ The Final Empire (1503)\cover.jpg,9780765350381,2007-02-15T13:10:43+00:00,Macmillan,,,1.0,"Fiction - Fantasy, Magic, Fiction, Despotism, Courts and courtiers, Women revolutionaries, Epic, General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Fantasy fiction, Action & Adventure, Fantasy - Epic, Fantasy",Mistborn: The Final Empire,1503
Bram Stoker,"'it was butcher work...the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam' Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic shocker introduced Count Dracula to the world, an ancient creature bent on bringing his contagion to London, the very heart of the British Empire. Only a handful of men and women stand between Dracula and his long-cherished goal, but they are vulnerable and weak against the cunning and supernatural powers of the Count and his legions. As the horrifying story unfolds in the diaries and letters of young Jonathan Harker, Lucy, Mina, and Dr Seward, Dracula will be victorious unless his nemesis Professor Van Helsing can persuade them that monsters still lurk in the era of electric light. The most famous of all vampire stories, Dracula is a mirror of its age, its underlying themes of race, religion, science, superstition, and sexuality never far from the surface. A compelling read, rattling along at break-neck speed, it is a modern classic. This new edition includes Stoker's companion piece, 'Dracula's Guest'.

Bob Woodward,"Plan of Attack is the definitive account of how and why President George W. Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam.  Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, Plan of Attack is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization.  What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin.  Plan of Attack provides new details on the intelligence assessments of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the planning for the war's aftermath.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Bob Woodward\Plan of Attack (1505)\cover.jpg,9780743262873,2004-04-21T14:21:21+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, International relations, Political Freedom & Security, Government, History, Presidents & Heads of State, Iraq War (2003-), General, 21st Century, Middle East, United States, Military, Social Science, Political Science, Terrorism, Legislative Branch",Plan of Attack,1505
Bob Woodward,"In Obama’s Wars, Bob Woodward provides the most intimate and sweeping portrait yet of the young president as commander in chief. Drawing on internal memos, classified documents, meeting notes and hundreds of hours of interviews with most of the key players, including the president, Woodward tells the inside story of Obama making the critical decisions on the Afghanistan War, the secret campaign in Pakistan and the worldwide fight against terrorism.At the core of Obama’s Wars is the unsettled division between the civilian leadership in the White House and the United States military as the president is thwarted in his efforts to craft an exit plan for the Afghanistan War. “So what’s my option?” the president asked his war cabinet, seeking alternatives to the Afghanistan commander’s request for 40,000 more troops in late 2009. “You have essentially given me one option...It’s unacceptable.” “Well,” Secretary of Defense Robert Gates finally said, “Mr. President, I think we owe you that option.” It never came. An untamed Vice President Joe Biden pushes relentlessly to limit the military mission and avoid another Vietnam. The vice president frantically sent half a dozen handwritten memos by secure fax to Obama on the eve of the final troop decision. President Obama’s ordering a surge of 30,000 troops and pledging to start withdrawing U.S. forces by July 2011 did not end the skirmishing. General David Petraeus, the new Afghanistan commander, thinks time can be added to the clock if he shows progress. “I don’t think you win this war,” Petraeus said privately. “This is the kind of fight we’re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids’ lives.” Hovering over this debate is the possibility of another terrorist attack in the United States. The White House led a secret exercise showing how unprepared the government is if terrorists set off a nuclear bomb in an American city—which Obama told Woodward is at the top of the list of what he worries about all the time. Verbatim quotes from secret debates and White House strategy sessions—and firsthand accounts of the thoughts and concerns of the president, his war council and his generals—reveal a government in conflict, often consumed with nasty infighting and fundamental disputes. Woodward has discovered how the Obama White House really works, showing that even more tough decisions lie ahead for the cerebral and engaged president. Obama’s Wars offers the reader a stunning, you-are-there account of the president, his White House aides, military leaders, diplomats and intelligence chiefs in this time of turmoil and danger.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Bob Woodward\Obama's Wars (1506)\cover.jpg,9781439172506,2011-05-03T14:16:30+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, General, Current Events, United States - General, History: American, 2001-, 2001-2009, War on Terrorism, Presidents & Heads of State, United States - 21st Century, Political History, Executive Branch, Decision making, Government, 21st Century, Political Science, Politics, Government - Executive Branch, National security, History, American Government, Afghan War, United States",Obama's Wars,1506

Bill Clinton & William Jefferson Clinton,"President Bill Clinton's ""My Life is the strikingly candid portrait of a global leader who decided early in life to devote his intellectual and political gifts, and his extraordinary capacity for hard work, to serving the public. It shows us the progress of a remarkable American, who, through his own enormous energies and efforts, made the unlikely journey from Hope, Arkansas, to the White House--a journey fueled by an impassioned interest in the political process which manifested itself at every stage of his life: in college, working as an intern for Senator William Fulbright; at Oxford, becoming part of the Vietnam War protest movement; at Yale Law School, campaigning on the grassroots level for Democratic candidates; back in Arkansas, running for Congress, attorney general, and governor. We see his career shaped by his resolute determination to improve the life of his fellow citizens, an unfaltering commitment to civil rights, and an exceptional understanding of the practicalities of political life. We come to understand the emotional pressures of his youth--born after his father's death; caught in the dysfunctional relationship between his feisty, nurturing mother and his abusive stepfather, whom he never ceased to love and whose name he took; drawn to the brilliant, compelling Hillary Rodham, whom he was determined to marry; passionately devoted, from her infancy, to their daughter, Chelsea, and to the entire experience of fatherhood; slowly and painfully beginning to comprehend how his early denial of pain led him at times into damaging patterns of behavior. President Clinton's book is also the fullest, most concretely detailed, most nuanced account of a presidencyever written--encompassing not only the high points and crises but the way the presidency actually works: the day-to-day bombardment of problems, personalities, conflicts, setbacks, achievements. It is a testament to the positive impact on America and on the world of his work and his ideals. It is the gripping account of a president under concerted and unrelenting assault orchestrated by his enemies on the Far Right, and how he survived and prevailed. It is a treasury of moments caught alive, among them: - The ten-year-old boy watching the national political conventions on his family's new (and first) television set. - The young candidate looking for votes in the Arkansas hills and the local seer who tells him, ""Anybody who would campaign at a beer joint in Joiner at midnight on Saturday night deserves to carry one box. . . . You'll win here. But it'll be the only damn place you win in this county."" (He was right on both counts.) - The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign. - The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. - The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin. - The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency. Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice.

After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens--as he later put it, ""it was clear my people needed me""). They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item.  Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, I'm a Stranger Here Myself recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth.

The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes--and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings. For a start there's the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson's acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America's last great wilderness.

Bill Bryson,"One of the world’s most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

He explores those forces--from the fear of losing, to the perpetual need to raise money, to the power of the media--that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats--from terrorism to pandemic--that gather beyond our shores.

Since their initial publication, Rand's fictional works--Anthem, The Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged--have had a major impact on the intellectual scene. The underlying theme of her famous novels is her philosophy, a new morality--the ethics of rational self-interest--that offers a robust challenge to altruist-collectivist thought.  Known as Objectivism, her divisive philosophy holds human life--the life proper to a rational being--as the standard of moral values and regards altruism as incompatible with man's nature. In this series of essays, Rand asks why man needs morality in the first place, and arrives at an answer that redefines a new code of ethics based on the virtue of selfishness.

Ayn Rand,"Anthem is Ayn Rand's classic tale of a dark future age of the great ""We""-a world that deprives individuals of name, independence, and values. Written a full decade before George Orwell's ""1984,"" this dystopian novel depicts a man who seeks escape from a society in which individuality has been utterly destroyed.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali,"In this profoundly affecting memoir from the internationally renowned author of The Caged Virgin, Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells her astonishing life story, from her traditional Muslim childhood in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya, to her intellectual awakening and activism in the Netherlands, and her current life under armed guard in the West.  One of today's most admired and controversial political figures, Ayaan Hirsi Ali burst into international headlines following an Islamist's murder of her colleague, Theo van Gogh, with whom she made the movie Submission.  Infidel is the eagerly awaited story of the coming of age of this elegant, distinguished -- and sometimes reviled -- political superstar and champion of free speech. With a gimlet eye and measured, often ironic, voice, Hirsi Ali recounts the evolution of her beliefs, her ironclad will, and her extraordinary resolve to fight injustice done in the name of religion. Raised in a strict Muslim family and extended clan, Hirsi Ali survived civil war, female mutilation, brutal beatings, adolescence as a devout believer during the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and life in four troubled, unstable countries largely ruled by despots. In her early twenties, she escaped from a forced marriage and sought asylum in the Netherlands, where she earned a college degree in political science, tried to help her tragically depressed sister adjust to the West, and fought for the rights of Muslim immigrant women and the reform of Islam as a member of Parliament. Even though she is under constant threat -- demonized by reactionary Islamists and politicians, disowned by her father, and expelled from her family and clan -- she refuses to be silenced.  Ultimately a celebration of triumph over adversity, Hirsi Ali's story tells how a bright little girl evolved out of dutiful obedience to become an outspoken, pioneering freedom fighter. As Western governments struggle to balance democratic ideals with religious pressures, no story could be timelier or more significant.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ayaan Hirsi Ali\Infidel (1527)\cover.jpg,9780743289696,2008-04-15T13:58:11+01:00,Simon and Schuster,,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Islamic Studies, Women, Political, Personal Memoirs, General, Refugees, Muslims, Politicians, Social Science",Infidel,1527
Arthur Miller,"A haunting examination of groupthink and mass hysteria in a rural community   &quot;I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history,&quot; Arthur Miller wrote in an introduction to The Crucible, his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events, Miller&#39;s drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria.   In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town&#39;s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.   Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy&#39;s &quot;witch-hunts&quot; in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: &quot;Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.&quot;  For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,"Sherlock Holmes (/ˈʃɜrlɒk ˈhoʊmz/) is a fictional detective created by Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School. A London-based ""consulting detective"" whose abilities border on the fantastic, Holmes is famous for his astute logical reasoning, his ability to adopt almost any disguise, and his use of forensic science skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes, who first appeared in publication in 1887, was featured in four novels and 56 short stories. The first novel, A Study in Scarlet, appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual in 1887 and the second, The Sign of the Four, in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890. The character grew tremendously in popularity with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" in 1891; further series of short stories and two novels published in serial form appeared between then and 1927. The stories cover a period from around 1880 up to 1914. All but four stories are narrated by Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (""The Blanched Soldier"" and ""The Lion's Mane"") and two others are written in the third person (""The Mazarin Stone"" and ""His Last Bow""). In two stories (""The Musgrave Ritual"" and ""The Gloria Scott""), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear, each include a long interval of omniscient narration recounting events unknown to either Holmes or Watson.

Arthur Charles Clarke,"The inspiration for the Syfy miniseries.  Childhood's End is one of the defining legacies of Arthur C. Clarke, the author of 2001: A Space Odyssey and many other groundbreaking works. Since its publication in 1953, this prescient novel about first contact gone wrong has come to be regarded not only as a science fiction classic but as a literary thriller of the highest order.  Spaceships have suddenly appeared in the skies above every city on the planet. Inside is an intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior alien race known as the Overlords. At first, their demands seem benevolent: unify Earth, eliminate poverty, end war. But at what cost? To those who resist, it's clear that the Overlords have an agenda of their own.

Arthur Charles Clarke & Stanley Kubrick,"The classic science fiction novel that captures and expands on the vision of Stanley Kubrick's immortal film--and changed the way we look at the stars and ourselves.  From the savannas of Africa at the dawn of mankind to the rings of Saturn as man ventures to the outer rim of our solar system, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike any other.  This allegory about humanity's exploration of the universe--and the universe's reaction to humanity--is a hallmark achievement in storytelling that follows the crew of the spacecraft Discovery as they embark on a mission to Saturn. Their vessel is controlled by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer capable of the highest level of cognitive functioning that rivals--and perhaps threatens--the human mind.  Grappling with space exploration, the perils of technology, and the limits of human power, 2001: A Space Odyssey continues to be an enduring classic of cinematic scope.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Arthur Charles Clarke\2001, a Space Odyssey (1531)\cover.jpg",9780451452733,1993-02-15T12:12:58+00:00,ROC,,,1.0,"Fiction, Human-computer interaction, Science fiction, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Fiction - Science Fiction, Twenty-first century, Movie novels, General, American Science Fiction And Fantasy, Classics, Outer space, Space Opera, Science Fiction - General, Computers, Space vehicles","2001, a Space Odyssey",1531

Anne Rice,"Returning to the hypnotic world she so brilliantly created in Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice demonstrates once again her power to enthrall. With the same richness of drama, atmosphere and incident, she tells the fantastic story of the vampire Lestat, whom we first perceived as the seductive devil-vampire of Interview with the Vampire and whom we now follow through the ages as he searches for the origin and meaning of his own dark immortality. And who, more and more, engages our sympathy until he stands revealed as a questing romantic, a vampire-hero with his own strange and passionate courage and morality.  As the novel opens, Lestat, having risen from the earth after a fifty-five years' sleep, and infatuated with the modern world, presents himself in all his vampire brilliance as a rock star, a superstar, a seducer of millions. And, in this blaze of adulation, daring to break the vampire oath of silence, he determines to tell his story, to rouse the generations of the living dead from their slumbers and to penetrate the riddle of his own existence.  As he speaks we are plunged back into eighteenth-century France, into the castle where we meet the young Lestat: child of impoverished aristocrats, heroic hunter of wolves, at odds with his tyrannical father, running away to join a traveling troupe of actors. We see him in the licentious Paris of the day, first apprentice at a boulevard theater, then its most celebrated actor, idolized, adored by many and--night after night--watched by one . . . until, in a sleep filled with dreams of the wolves he killed as a boy, he is shocked awake by a dark figure and suddenly, horribly, eternally joined to the unholy brotherhood.  We follow Lestat as he searches for others like him--in churches and brothels, in gambling houses, huts and palaces--sometimes joined by the vampire-angel Gabrielle, who is bound to him both by blood and by passion; sometimes traveling with his adored Nicolas, the violinist whose music and beauty are equally transcendent. We follow Lestat as he travels from the snowcapped mountains of the Auvergne and the primeval forest of ancient Gaul to Sicily, Istanbul, Venice and Cairo, searching for his origins, sometimes finding clues to the birth of the vampire race, knowing always that the central truth eludes him.  But all the while, throughout his travels, through many lands and many times, Lestat has made enemies among his brethren--vampires who are in terror of his questions, who fear he will disturb the uneasy balance in which they exist with the mortal world, and who suspect in him a desire to rule. And when, in the caves below a craggy Greek island, in a sanctuary whose walls are covered with gold-flecked murals, the very first of the living dead awake, the truth at the heart of his quest is at last revealed. Ancient forces held immobile through the ages are irreversibly set in motion, and as the novel rushes to its stunning climax, Lestat's vampire foes converge in pursuit of him on the demonic freeways of the twentieth century.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Anne Rice\The Vampire Lestat (1536)\cover.jpg,9780394534435,1985-02-15T13:44:43+00:00,Knopf,,,1.0,"Fiction, Modern fiction, Vampires, Horror - General, Horror fiction, Fiction - Horror, Horror tales, General, Lestat (Fictitious character), Horror, General & Literary Fiction, Horror & Ghost Stories",The Vampire Lestat,1536

Now, we go with Armand across the centuries to the Kiev Rus of his boyhood--a ruined city under Mongol dominion--and to ancient Constantinople, where Tartar raiders sell him into slavery. And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood.

Welcome to Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, sun-drenched gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelganger, a spirit known as Goblin, a spirit from a dreamworld that Quinn can't escape and that prevents him from belonging anywhere. When Quinn is made a vampire, losing all that is rightfully his and gaining an unwanted immortality, his doppelganger becomes even more vampiric and terrifying than Quinn himself.

Excerpt from book: apartment of the captain of the musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel. CHAPTER III. THE AUDIENCE. M. De Treville was at the moment in rather an ill-humour; nevertheless, he saluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground, and he smiled on receiving his compliment, the Be""arnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country, a double remembrance, which makes a man smile at all ages. But stepping towards the antechamber, and making a sign to d'Artagnan with his hand, as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he went through all the tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent. "" Athos ! Porthos ! Aramis !"" The two musketeers, with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who answered to the last two of these three names, immediately quitted the group of which they formed a part, and advanced towards the cabinet, the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of D'Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demi-gods, and in their leader an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders. When the two musketeers had entered, when the door was closed behind them, when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh aliment, had recommenced; when M. de TreVille had three or four times paced in silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and sil...",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Alexandre Dumas\The Three Musketeers (1878) (1559)\cover.jpg,9780217399869,2009-08-15T14:44:27+01:00,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,,,1.0,"Action & Adventure, Fiction, Historical, Romance",The Three Musketeers (1878),1559

One of the most prophetic dystopian works."" —Wall Street Journal Aldous Huxley's profoundly important classic of world literature, Brave New World is a searching vision of an unequal, technologically-advanced future where humans are genetically bred, socially indoctrinated, and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian ruling order–all at the cost of our freedom, full humanity, and perhaps also our souls. “A genius [who] who spent his life decrying the onward march of the Machine” (The New Yorker), Huxley was a man of incomparable talents: equally an artist, a spiritual seeker, and one of history’s keenest observers of human nature and civilization. Brave New World, his masterpiece, has enthralled and terrified millions of readers, and retains its urgent relevance to this day as both a warning to be heeded as we head into tomorrow and as thought-provoking, satisfying work of literature. Written in the shadow of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, Brave New World likewise speaks to a 21st-century world dominated by mass-entertainment, technology, medicine and pharmaceuticals, the arts of persuasion, and the hidden influence of elites. ""Aldous Huxley is the greatest 20th century writer in English."" —Chicago Tribune",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Aldous Huxley\Brave New World (1562)\cover.jpg,9780060850524,2006-10-17T13:21:28+01:00,HarperCollins,,,1.0,"General, Political fiction, Dystopias, Literature - Classics, Psychological fiction, Criticism, Political, Literature: Classics, Genetic engineering, Totalitarianism, Aldous, Fiction, Collectivism, 1894-1963, Psychological, Science fiction, Romance, Passivity (Psychology), Classics, Huxley, Dystopian",Brave New World,1562

Adam Carolla,"A couple years back, I was at the Phoenix airport bar.  It was empty except for one heavy-set, gray bearded, grizzled guy who looked like he just rode his donkey into town after a long day of panning for silver in them thar hills.  He ordered a Jack Daniels straight up, and that's when I overheard the young guy with the earring behind the bar asking him if he had ID.  At first the old sea captain just laughed.  But the guy with the twinkle in his ear asked again.  At this point it became apparent that he was serious.  Dan Haggerty's dad fired back, ""You've got to be kidding me, son.""  The bartender replied, ""New policy.  Everyone has to show their ID.""  Then I watched Burl Ives reluctantly reach into his dungarees and pull out his military identification card from World War II.It's a sad and eerie harbinger of our times that the Oprah-watching, crystal-rubbing, Whole Foods-shopping moms and their whipped attorney husbands have taken the ability to reason away from the poor schlub who makes the Bloody Marys.  What we used to settle with common sense or a fist, we now settle with hand sanitizer and lawyers.  Adam Carolla has had enough of this insanity and he's here to help us get our collective balls back. In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks is Adam's comedic gospel of modern America. He rips into the absurdity of the culture that demonized the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, turned the nation's bathrooms into a lawless free-for-all of urine and fecal matter, and put its citizens at the mercy of a bunch of minimum wagers with axes to grind. Peppered between complaints Carolla shares candid anecdotes from his day to day life as well as his past—Sunday football at Jimmy Kimmel's house, his attempts to raise his kids in a society that he mostly disagrees with, his big showbiz break, and much, much more. Brilliantly showcasing Adam's spot-on sense of humor, this book cements his status as a cultural commentator/comedian/complainer extraordinaire. ADAM CAROLLA is a radio and television host, comedian, and actor. He is the host of the Adam Carolla Podcast, before which he hosted a weekday morning radio program broadcast from Los Angeles, and syndicated by CBS Radio. Besides these shows, Carolla is well known as the co-host of the radio show Loveline (and its television incarnation on MTV), as the co-creator and co-host of Comedy Central's The Man Show, and as the co-creator and the performer on Comedy Central and MTV's Crank Yankers and is a frequent contributor and contestant on ABC's top-rated program ""Dancing with the Stars"".

She discovers that for many years her father had been accessing the magic that flowed, literally, in a blue stream beneath the earth, leaking into his house. When she starts to use the liquid ""vitagua"" to enchant everyday items, the results seem innocent enough: a ""'chanted"" watch becomes a charm that means you're always in the right place at the right time; a ""'chanted"" pendant enables the wearer to convince anyone of anything . . .But as events in Indigo Springs unfold and the true potential of vitagua is revealed, Astrid and her friends unwittingly embark on a journey fraught with power, change, and a future too devastating to contemplate.

Jacobs's hilarious, enlightening, and seemingly impossible quest to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica from A to Z.To fill the ever-widening gaps in his Ivy League education, A.J. Jacobs sets for himself the daunting task of reading all thirty-two volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. His wife, Julie, tells him it's a waste of time, his friends believe he is losing his mind, and his father, a brilliant attorney who had once attempted the same feat and quit somewhere around Borneo, is encouraging but, shall we say, unconvinced.With self-deprecating wit and a disarming frankness, The Know-It-All recounts the unexpected and comically disruptive effects Operation Encyclopedia has on every part of Jacobs's life -- from his newly minted marriage to his complicated relationship with his father and the rest of his charmingly eccentric New York family to his day job as an editor at Esquire. Jacobs's project tests the outer limits of his stamina and forces him to explore the real meaning of intelligence as he endeavors to join Mensa, win a spot on Jeopardy!, and absorb 33,000 pages of learning. On his journey he stumbles upon some of the strangest, funniest, and most profound facts about every topic under the sun, all while battling fatigue, ridicule, and the paralyzing fear that attends his first real-life responsibility -- the impending birth of his first child.The Know-It-All is an ingenious, mightily entertaining memoir of one man's intellect, neuroses, and obsessions and a soul-searching, ultimately touching struggle between the all-consuming quest for factual knowledge and the undeniable gift of hard-won wisdom.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\A.

A teacher in Harlem and two sanitation workers on Wall Street are found dead, their swollen bodies nearly dissolved from the inside out. The predator is a deadly supercolony of ants--an army of one trillion soldiers with razor-sharp claws that pierce skin like paper and stinging venom that liquefies its prey.The desperate mayor turns to the greatest ant expert in the world, Paul O'Keefe, a Pulitzer Prize–winning scientist in an Armani suit. But Paul is baffled by the ants. They are twice the size of any normal ant and have no recognizable DNA. They're vicious in the field yet docile in the hand. Paul calls on the one person he knows can help destroy the colony, his ex-wife Kendra Hart, a spirited entomologist studying fire ants in the New Mexico desert. Kendra is taken to a secret underground bunker in New York City, where she finds herself working side by side with her brilliant but arrogant ex-husband and a high-ranking military officer hell-bent on stopping the insects with a nuclear bomb.When the ants launch an all-out attack, Paul and Kendra hit the dangerous, panic-stricken streets of New York, searching for a coveted queen. It's a race to unlock the secrets of an indestructible new species, before the president nukes Manhattan.A.J. Colucci's debut novel is a terrifying mix of classic Michael Crichton and Stephen King.

Yuval Noah Harari,"""From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution--a #1 international bestseller--that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ""human."" One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas .Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

Zia Haider Rahman,"Numa manhã de setembro, um investidor da banca, a rondar os quarenta anos, com a carreira em colapso e o casamento em queda-livre, recebe uma visita-surpresa na sua moradia de Londres. Após a dificuldade inicial em identificar uma figura pobremente vestida e de mochila às costas, acaba por reconhecer nela o amigo dos tempos da faculdade, um tipo brilhante que desaparecera anos atrás em circunstâncias misteriosas. Ao longo dos dias que se seguirão, Zafar contará a sua história. 
À Luz do Que Sabemos é a epopeia de um homem e da sua desintegração psicológica - e uma peça extraordinária de uma nova literatura pós-colonial. Temas como a não-pertença, o deslocamento, a emigração e a migração voluntária e económica - e também a política, a história, a religião e a matemática. Uma história repleta de histórias e de personagens em movimento, com ecos de W.G. Sebald e de Teju Cole. 
Uma ligação amorosa entre Zafar - o bem-sucedido filho de emigrantes do Bangladesh - e Emily, filha da elite aristocrática - atravessa toda a narrativa, que se desenrola entre Londres, Nova Iorque, Bangladesh e o Afeganistão. À Luz do Que Sabemos é um romance enciclopédico, mas é também um livro sobre tudo aquilo que não sabemos ou que não conseguimos saber.

Yukio Mishima,"Yukio Mishima, nome de grande importância para a literatura japonesa, com uma extensa obra publicada, e alguns inéditos no Brasil, traz ao leitor, em Vida à venda, uma viagem ácida e divertida sobre o valor da vida. Ou, mais do que isso, sobre a vida e a morte à margem dos dias e do desencantamento. 2020 marca o cinquentenário da morte de Mishima, e é a morte, tema constante na obra do autor, que aparece em Vida à venda como um acinzentar da alma, sem que seja, necessariamente, um pesar. Rilke escreveu que o homem moderno não pode morrer de forma romântica. E é assim que Hanio Yamada, um desiludido publicitário, e personagem principal desse romance, entende o seu desejo de morrer. De atravessar o presente. De forma pragmática, após uma frustrada tentativa de suicídio, Hanio anuncia a escolha de vender a própria vida, para que assim alguém possa direcioná-la a uma melhor forma de finitude, ou que possa, na verdade, subverter o tédio. ""Vendo minha vida. Use-a como quiser. Homem de 27 anos. Garanto sigilo. Tranquilidade absoluta."" Entre Hanio e o leitor se estabelece uma relação de proximidade, cumplicidade, busca pelos caminhos da alma, e pelos sentimentos humanos. Viagem que se desencadeia ora sombria, ora irreverente. É no emaranhado de tentativas de vendas, que se torna um grande negócio, que descobrimos uma ideia cheia de possibilidades - e uma sucessão de personagens que beiram o fantástico. O desenrolar dessa aventura tem como traço a ácida narrativa de Mishima, numa obra de forte irreverência, que prende o leitor até o último momento; misturando humor, profundidade, sexualidade, paixão e críticas à sociedade e aos costumes nela estabelecidos. Um dos últimos livros de Mishima, Vida à venda, foi publicado originalmente na revista Playboy do Japão, entre maio e outubro de 1968. Foi com o relançamento japonês, em 2015, que se tornou um best-seller, chegando a ser adaptado para uma série televisiva em dez episódios.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Yukio Mishima\Vida A Venda (1593)\cover.jpg,9788574483146,1968-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,Estaçao Liberdade,4,,1.0,Colecção Dois Mundos,Vida À Venda,1593

Yasmina Reza,"Um pai, no fim da sua vida, dirige-se ao filho para expressar-lhe toda a sua ""desolação"". Esse monólogo exprime o seu rancor contra todos - familiares, amigos, pessoas com quem se cruza na rua - mas muito particularmente contra o filho. Um filho que se converteu a uma época de conformismo brando, na qual imperam as aparências e a superficialidade. Um filho que escolheu ser um ""adaptado"" e cuja única ambição é ser feliz. Feliz. Uma palavra ""asquerosa"", inconveniente: ""Teria preferido um filho criminoso ou terrorista do que um militante da felicidade"".  
Obra tonificante, construída com a energia do desespero. «Uma Desolação» é como que uma poderosa bofetada na cara de uma época - a nossa - que coloca os bons sentimentos à frente dos grandes carácteres.

Wladyslaw Szpilman, um jovem e talentoso pianista polaco, tocava ao vivo na rádio o Nocturno em Dó Menor de Chopin. Nas ruas, as explosões das bombas germânicas quase emudeciam a fabulosa melodia. Seria a última transmissão ao vivo a partir de Varsóvia, abruptamente interrompida por uma bomba alemã.

William Faulkner,"""O Som e a Fúria"" é a tragédia da família Compson, apresentando algumas das personagens mais memoráveis da literatura: a bela e rebelde Caddy, Benjy, o filho varão, o assombrado e neurótico Quentin; Jason, o cínico brutal, e Dilsey, o criado negro. Com as suas vidas fragmentadas e atormentadas pela história e pela herança, as suas vozes e ações enredam-se para criar o que é, sem dúvida, a obra-prima de Faulkner e um dos maiores romances do século XX. William Faulkner afirmou muitas vezes que ""O Som e a Fúria"" era o romance mais próximo do seu coração porque era o que lhe tinha causado mais sofrimento e angústia a escrever. Neste magnífico romance, publicado pela primeira vez em 1929, Faulkner criou a «menina dos seus olhos», a bela e trágica Caddy Compson, cuja história nos conta através dos monólogos separados dos seus três irmãos: Benjy, o idiota; Quentin, o suicida neurótico; e o monstruoso Jason. ""O Som e a Fúria"" é o seu quarto romance e a primeira das suas obras- primas indiscutíveis, aquela que, mais do que qualquer outra, confirmou Faulkner como figura central da literatura do século XX.

William Golding,"Um avião despenha-se numa ilha deserta, e os únicos sobreviventes são um grupo de rapazes. Inicialmente, desfrutando da liberdade total e festejando a ausência de adultos, unem forças, cooperando na procura de alimentos, na construção de abrigos e na manutenção de sinais de fogo. A supervisioná-los está Ralph, um jovem ponderado, e o seu amigo gorducho e esperto, Piggy. Apesar de Ralph tentar impor a ordem e delegar responsabilidades, muitos dos rapazes preferem celebrar a ausência de adultos nadando, brincando ou caçando a grande população de porcos selvagens que habita a ilha. O mais feroz adversário de Ralph é Jack, o líder dos caçadores, que consegue arrastar consigo a maioria dos rapazes. No entanto, à medida que o tempo passa, o frágil sentido de ordem desmorona-se.

William Faulkner.,"Um dos romances mais admirados e emblemáticos deste Prémio Nobel da Literatura.Luz em Agosto é um romance sobre a perseverança do ser humano face à sua mortalidade, onde se encontram algumas das personagens mais memoráveis de William Faulkner: a cândida e intrépida Lena Grove, em busca do pai do filho que carrega no ventre; o reverendo Gail Hightower, atormentado por visões de soldados da cavalaria confederada; e Joe Natal, um vagabundo desesperado e enigmático, consumido pela sua ascendência mestiça. Joe Natal não sabe se é negro ou branco, e Faulkner faz da tragédia desta personagem uma poderosa denúncia do racismo. Ao mesmo tempo, a vida de Joe é um estudo do Eu dividido, e tornou-se um símbolo do homem do século XX.Entrelaçando com mestria as histórias destas personagens, Luz em Agosto dá vida ao Sul imaginário de Faulkner, uma das maiores invenções da literatura, em toda a sua glória e fascínio. Esta edição reproduz o texto corrigido de Luz em Agosto, conforme estabelecido em 1985 pelo especialista em Faulkner, Noel Polk, tendo como base o texto original, datilografado pelo autor.

William Faulkner,"Um Sul de túmulos e fantasmas, marcado pela Guerra Civil e pela segregação racial, num dos romances mais sombrios e violentos da literatura americana. Numa narrativa composta de fragmentos delirantes de passado, o prêmio Nobel de literatura de 1949 William Faulkner conta a história da ascensão e queda do self-made man Thomas Sutpen que, vindo da miséria das montanhas do estado da Virgínia, torna-se o maior plantador de algodão do condado fictício de Yoknapatawpha. Publicado em 1936, Absalão, Absalão! revisita, através do apuro da técnica modernista, temas comumente identificados a certo gótico sulista, colocando assim em julgamento o estatuto do romance como gênero e construindo uma das mais brutais jornadas ao coração alucinado do século XX.

From its first publication in 1816 Rob Roy has been recognised as containing some of Scott's finest writing and most engaging, fully realised characters. The outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor was already a legendary, disputed figure by the time Scott wrote - a heroic Scottish Robin Hood to some, an over-glamorised, unprincipled predator to others. Scott approaches Rob Roy indirectly, through the adventures of his fictional hero, Frank Osbaldistone, amid the political turmoil of England and Scotland in 1715. With characteristic care Scott reconstructs the period and settings so as to place Rob Roy and the Scotland he inhabits amid conflicting moral, economic and historical forces. This edition features, besides a new critical introduction and extensive explanatory notes, an essay outlining clearly the novel's historical context and a glossary of Scottish words and phrases used by Scott's colourful, vernacular characters.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Walter Scott\Rob Roy (1605)\cover.jpg,9781853262531,1995-02-15T13:28:03+00:00,Wordsworth Editions,4,Waverley Novels,4.0,"Fiction, História, Classics, Romance, Clássicos Europa-América",Rob Roy,1605

W. Somerset Maugham,"Florença. Uma magnífica casa nas colinas serve de cenário para um sonho que, subitamente, se transformará em pesadelo... Nesse refúgio de tranquilidade, as violentas emoções do passado são momentaneamente eclipsadas e Mary Panton pode encarar calmamente as perspectivas do seu segundo casamento com Sir Edgar Swift — que ela admira e respeita, mas não ama. Um simples acto de compaixão, o desejo de proporcionar alguma beleza à vida atribulada e infeliz de um jovem refugiado, vai no entanto dar início a um pesadelo de violência que destruirá a ténue serenidade de Mary. Intuitivamente, ela vai confiar na ajuda e compreensão de Rowley Flint, um estranho de reputação mais que duvidosa. E compreenderá com ele que rejeitar o amor, mesmo com todos os seus múltiplos riscos, é rejeitar a própria vida. Escrito com a simplicidade das grandes obras literárias, Paixão em Florença é um exemplo perfeito da genialidade de Somerset Maugham.

Walter Riso,"Quantas vezes dissemos «sim» quando queríamos dizer «não»? Ou deixámos que nos ofendessem, sem dar resposta? Quantas vezes, ao chegar a casa ao fim de um dia de trabalho, nos censurámos pela incapacidade de fazer valer os nossos direitos?  
Essa insegurança, que nos leva a agir contra a nossa vontade, paga-se caro: sempre que baixamos a cabeça, estamos a dar um golpe na nossa auto-estima, sentimo-nos diminuídos. No sentido oposto, quando exigimos respeito a terceiros, protegemo-nos, fortalecemos o nosso «Eu», conquistamos o espaço e a importância que nos são devidos.  
Como defender então os nossos direitos sem violar os dos outros? O psicólogo e professor universitário Walter Riso estudou o problema ao longo de mais de 20 anos, como investigador e como terapeuta. E descobriu que a melhor forma de o fazer é utilizar uma ferramenta psicológica altamente eficaz: a assertividade.  
Saber dizer «não» ou «basta» sempre que a ocasião exige, é ter a liberdade e a coragem de expressar livremente as nossas emoções.

W. Somerset Maugham,"Julia Lambert está no auge do seu sucesso: é considerada a maior actriz inglesa do seu tempo. No palco, é uma verdadeira profissional, dominando totalmente as suas emoções, e as suas actuações são arrebatadoras. Na vida real, está cansada do marido e é bastante menos disciplinada. Quando um tímido e jovem fã a cobre de atenções, Julia fica inicialmente divertida, mais tarde entusiasmada pela sua persistência e, por fim, louca e perigosamente apaixonada… A sua vida, até então aparentemente perfeita e imperturbável, vai sofrer uma viragem irreversível. 
Ainda que Maugham seja preferencialmente aclamado enquanto romancista e escritor de contos, foi enquanto dramaturgo que ele conheceu inicialmente o sucesso. O presente romance é um testemunho desse seu entusiasmo pelos palcos.

Quando finalmente foi libertado, no fim da guerra, a mulher estava morta, tal como os pais e o irmão. No entanto, ele alimentara-se de outro sonho enquanto estava preso, e, este sim, viria a realizar-se: projetava-se no futuro, via-se a falar perante um público imaginário, e a explicar o seu método para enfrentar o maior dos horrores. E sobreviver. Viktor E. Frankl sobreviveu. E até morrer, aos 92 anos, divulgou por todo o mundo o método desenvolvido no campo de concentração - a Logoterapia.

Vassili Grossman,"Tudo Passa é o testemunho final de Vassili Grossman, romance inacabado, cuja revisão ocupou os seus últimos dias. Ivan Grigórievitch tem vivido num Gulag nos últimos trinta anos. Posto em liberdade após a morte de Stálin, descobre que os anos de terror impuseram uma escravidão moral coletiva. Ivan terá então de esforçar-se por encontrar o seu lugar num mundo que lhe é estranho. Mas, num romance que procura abordar acontecimentos trágicos da União Soviética, a história de Ivan é apenas uma entre muitas. Assim, conhecemos também o primo de Ivan, Nikolai, um cientista que nunca deixou a sua consciência interferir na sua carreira, Pinéguin, o informador que levou a que Ivan fosse enviado para o campo de trabalhos forçados, e ainda uma série de outros informadores, cada qual com uma desculpa para os seus indesculpáveis feitos. E, no centro do romance, encontramos a história de Anna Serguéevna, amante de Ivan, que nos conta o seu envolvimento como ativista no terror que foi a Grande Fome da Ucrânia - uma ação deliberada de extermínio, desencadeada pelo regime soviético, que levou à morte de milhões de camponeses. Tudo Passa é um romance insuportavelmente lúcido sobre o sofrimento humano, de um dos gigantes da literatura do século xx.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Vassili Grossman\Tudo Passa (1626)\cover.jpg,9789722051767,2013-10-29T13:47:44+00:00,Leya,,,1.0,"Fiction, General, Autores Estrangeiros, Ficção - Romance, Romance",Tudo Passa,1626
Vassili Grossman,"As reflexões de um grande escritor sobre a trágica história de um povo num relato cheio de ternura, entusiasmo e humor.  
Depois de o governo soviético ter confiscado – ou, como Grossman preferia dizer, «prendido» – Vida e Destino, o autor assumiu a tarefa de rever uma tradução para russo de um extenso romance arménio. O texto era de pouco interesse para ele, mas ficou feliz por ter uma desculpa para viajar para a Arménia. Bem Hajam! é o seu relato dos dois meses que lá passou. Escrito em 1962, dois anos antes da morte de Vassili Grossman, esta obra não tem comparação com nenhuma outra do autor.Este é, de longe, o seu livro mais pessoal e intimista, dotado de um ambiente de espontaneidade absoluta, em que Grossman parece estar simplesmente a conversar com o leitor acerca das suas impressões sobre a Arménia – as suas montanhas, igrejas antigas, gentes e costumes –, enquanto, ao mesmo tempo, examina os seus pensamentos e estados de espírito.Relato maravilhosamente humano de uma viagem a um lugar distante, repleto das observações vívidas de um estrangeiro, Bem Hajam! é também uma reflexão de Grossman sobre o seu lugar na União Soviética como escritor, a dignidade humana e a sua mortalidade.Vassili Grossman nasceu em 1905, na Ucrânia (em Berditchev, terra judaica, onde a sua própria mãe foi vítima do extermínio de judeus pelos nazis, em 1941-1942), e foi viver para Moscovo ainda jovem. Nos anos 1930 formou-se em engenharia química (como Primo Levi) mas começou a dedicar-se exclusivamente à escrita desde essa altura. Em 1941, tornou-se correspondente do Estrela Vermelha, jornal do Exército Vermelho, fazendo reportagens sobre a defesa de Stalinegrado, a queda de Berlim e as consequências do Holocausto. Vida e Destino, a sua obra-prima, foi um livro considerado tão perigoso na União Soviética que não só o manuscrito como também as fitas com que foi digitado foram confiscados pelo KGB, permanecendo desaparecido durante vinte anos. Grossman morreu em 1964, em Moscovo.

Vasili Grossman,"Vassili Grossman, adotando a estrutura global de Tolstói em Guerra e Paz, pinta em Vida e Destino um imenso fresco da Rússia soviética, com incidência nos anos da Segunda Guerra Mundial, na ofensiva alemã e na defesa e, depois, na contraofensiva soviética, que culminou na libertação de Stalinegrado e dos territórios ocupados pelos nazis.  
Intercalando um petrificante relato da batalha de Stalinegrado com a história de uma família de classe média, dispersa pelas forças do destino entre a Alemanha e a Sibéria, Vassili Grossman constrói uma imensa e intrincada trama que retrata um tempo de horror quase inimaginável e de esperança ainda mais estranha. Vida e Destino intercala ambientes familiares com refúgios de snipers, laboratórios científicos e o Gulag, transportando-nos ao fundo dos corações e mentes de uma formidável galeria de personagens, que vão de um rapaz a caminho da câmara de gás até aos próprios Hitler e Stálin.

Vários,"“O que é uma lengalenga?” Poderão alguns perguntar. Ora, bem, uma   
lengalenga é uma cantilena, uma rima ou um texto curto, na qual se repetem   
determinadas palavras ou expressões que permitem que a mesma se decore com facilidade. Geralmente estão associadas a brincadeiras e jogos infantis e são transmitidas de geração em geração, havendo algumas que são ditas cantadas à centenas de anos.  
Tal como os provérbios, os adágios e as cantigas populares, as lengalengas fazem parte da cultura de um povo, embora não lhes seja dada tanta importância pelos académicos como as demais expressões folclóricas, possivelmente por fazerem parte do universo infantil. Mas as lengalengas não são apenas rimas que têm dado cor às brincadeiras de   
crianças. Elas também têm um valor e um contexto próprio. Por detrás de muitas delas, sobretudo as mais antigas, há uma história interessante   
sobre como surgiram e foram criadas; e algumas deixam a dúvida sobre o significado enigmático dos seus versos dando origem ao debate sobre o que pode ter estado na sua origem. Nos tempos medievais, por exemplo, uma lengalenga tinha quase sempre por base um evento que gerava a discussão popular. Eram criadas por pregões de praça ou “cómicos” de feiras e depois eram repetidos pelas crianças nas suas brincadeiras. Eram assim que  
nasciam as lengalengas populares.   
Ora, nesta presente compilação, reuniram-se um punhado de lengalengas   
antigas, apanhadas aqui e ali – da memória, de ouvido, de velhos livros, de investigação em bibliotecas e de pesquisas na internet. Demos primazia a lengalengas ainda vivas, cantadas ainda hoje, não tendo pretensões de reunir aquirimasmedievais de difícil entendimento e que requeriam traduções. O nosso objetivo foi despertar a nostalgia pelo recordação dos versos que fizeram parte da infância dos nossos avós, nos nossos pais, da nossa e, por ventura, dos nossos filhos. Que ao lê-las lhe seja dado a recordar e dizer: “Lembro-me desta"".

Coletânea de Histórias, Textos, Lendas e Poemas, de vários autores clássicos portugueses. 
Esta era uma das noites de exceção por excelência para aquelas boas gentes: esta era a noite de 24 de Dezembro; era véspera do dia de Natal, em que tudo na província festeja, risonha, tange, canta, come e bebe, já se sabe, devotamente, depois de ter ido ouvir a missa do Galo.  
Esta antologia de contos natalícios não é uma reunião de contos infantis, geralmente contados nesta época e cujo imaginário vem, nos dias de hoje, de uma ideia globalizada e comercial sobre o Natal e quais os elementos que o caracterizam. Não. Esta é uma reunião de contos, textos e poemas de Natal selecionados, de vários autores clássicos portugueses, tais como Eça de Queirós, Fernando Pessoa, Raul Brandão, Bocage, Abel Botelho, entre outros, que tanto oscilam para o lado festivo do Natal, como para o seu lado melancólico. Presente em muitos contos está a visão do Natal tradicional das aldeias do interior de Portugal que, com os seus costumes e tradições, caracterizam o Natal português. 
Foi também incluído nesta seleção de contos e poemas várias lendas tradicionais portuguesas relativas à época natalícia.

Do sonho de encontrar uma criança que o prolongue e de outros inesperados encontros, nasce uma família inventada, mas tão pura e fundamental como qualquer outra.As histórias do Crisóstomo e do Camilo, da Isaura, do Antonino e da Matilde mostram que para se ser feliz é preciso aceitar ser o que se pode, nunca deixando contudo de acreditar que é possível estar e ser sempre melhor. As suas vidas ilustram igualmente que o amor, sendo uma pacificação com a nossa natureza, tem o poder de a transformar.Tocando em temas tão basilares à vida humana como o amor, a paternidade e a família, O filho de mil homens exibe, como sempre, a apurada sensibilidade e o esplendor criativo de Valter Hugo Mãe.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Valter Hugo Mae\O Filho de Mil Homens (1633)\cover.jpg,9789896722159,2014-01-16T12:46:19+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Fiction, General",O Filho de Mil Homens,1633

Mas às portas do céu acotovelam-se mercadores de souvenirs em brigas constantes e São Pedro não faz mais do que a enxotar dali a cada visita.

O apocalipse dos trabalhadores é um retrato do nosso tempo, feito da precariedade e dessa esperança difícil.

Valter Hugo Mãe,"Grande voz da literatura portuguesa contemporânea, Valter Hugo Mãe lança Homens imprudentemente poéticos, obra ambientada no Japão antigo e na qual o autor proporciona uma imersão idílica na cultura milenar japonesa. Com sua habitual escrita poética e desconcertante, Mãe traz à tona os temas da morte e do suicídio, em um contexto em que este ato possui um ponto de vista distinto ao do ocidente. Segundo o autor, no Japão, “um suicida não é visto como um fraco ou desistente, é visto como alguém que entendeu sua existência e se sente preparado para se entregar à natureza”.Mãe situa seus personagens em uma aldeia no sopé do monte Fuji, próximo da região conhecida como a Floresta dos Suicidas, lugar que visitou enquanto escrevia a história. Os vizinhos, o artesão Itaro, que está em fase de preparação para a morte, e o oleiro Saburo são inimigos, mas devido às circunstâncias da vida, relativizam a discórdia e se opõem com cordialidade. De acordo com o escritor e jornalista Laurentino Gomes no prefácio do livro, “o mesmo olhar microscópico sobre a aldeia japonesa confere ao livro o tom de obra universal, de conteúdo profundamente humano, cujo enredo diz respeito a cada uma dos sete bilhões de pessoas que hoje habitam o planeta”.Tal como em seu romance A desumanização, que teve a Islândia como cenário, Mãe escolhe um lugar longínquo para retratar a história, levando o leitor ao Japão profundo, um ambiente sagrado que partilha o mesmo universo das fatalidades e da miséria. Diante das dificuldades e conscientes do valor da natureza exuberante que os cerca, os personagens passam a valorizar as pequenas alegrias do cotidiano e a espera da morte.A morte também está no próprio modo do autor tecer sua literatura e não apenas nos enredos de suas histórias. Homens imprudentemente poéticos nasce da necessidade de retornar a um momento de descoberta, como se estivesse escrevendo seu primeiro livro. Mudou, então, seu processo de escrita – em vez de corrigir e retocar o texto, ele escolheu reescreevê-lo. “É como se eu escrevesse vários livros ao mesmo tempo. Nunca se esgota o livro”, afirma.Agraciado com os prêmios José Saramago (2007), Grande Prêmio Portugal Telecom de melhor romance e livro do ano (2012), o escritor recebeu elogios de José Saramago, ganhador do único prêmio Nobel da língua portuguesa, que o definiu como um “tsunami literário”.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Valter Hugo Mae\Homens imprudentemente poeticos (1636)\cover.jpg,9788525063595,2016-11-09T12:54:46+00:00,Globo Livros,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Ficção portuguesa - Romance, General, Autores Portugueses",Homens imprudentemente poéticos,1636

Estamos em 1327. Numa abadia beneditina reúnem-se os teólogos de João XXII e os do Imperador. O objecto da discussão é a pregação dos Franciscanos, que chamam a igreja à pobreza evangélica e, implicitamente, à renúncia ao poder temporal.  
  
Guilherme de Baskerville, tendo chegado com Adso pouco antes das duas delegações, encontra-se subitamente envolvido numa verdadeira história policial. Um monge morreu misteriosamente, mas este é apenas o primeiro dos sete cadáveres que irão transtornar a comunidade durante sete dias. Guilherme recebe o encargo de investigar esses prováveis crimes. O encontro entre os teólogos fracassa, mas não a investigação do nosso Sherlock Holmes da Idade Média, atento decifrador de sinais, que através de uma série de descobertas extraordinárias, conseguira no final encontrar o culpado nos labirintos da Biblioteca.

Titus Müller,"Antero Moreira de Mendonça odeia os Jesuítas. Quando em 1755 um terramoto de proporções bíblicas arrasa a cidade de Lisboa e os Jesuítas pregam publicamente a fúria de Deus, o jovem entusiasta das ciências naturais vê chegada a oportunidade de se vingar da Companhia de Jesus. No entanto, Gabriel Malagrida, o líder dos Jesuítas a quem o povo reconhece poderes proféticos, revelar-se-á um opositor à altura. Contando com a ajuda de Leonor, filha de um comerciante alemão, Antero irá conseguir escapar-se ao cadafalso e à masmorra. Aquilo que Antero desconhece é que Leonor se conta entre os fiéis seguidores da ordem jesuíta. Que partido acabará o coração de Leonor por tomar? O de Antero ou o dos seus correligionários jesuítas?

Tina Vallès,"«Posso ficar contente?» Jan não sabe porquê, mas intui que não é uma notícia muito boa que agora passem a ser cinco em casa. Os avós Joan e Caterina deixaram Vilaverd e vieram instalar-se com eles no andar do bairro de Sant Antoni, em Barcelona. Esta mudança alterará o dia a dia em casa, onde as palavras e os silêncios adquirirão novos significados. Mas Jan e Joan têm o seu mundo, cheio de passeios, árvores e letras com mais significado do que parece. Entretanto, os adultos fazem o possível para que tudo continue como sempre. Jan repara nos pormenores à sua volta e vai juntando-os para perceber o que se passa. As conversas entre avô e neto, com perguntas sem resposta e respostas sem pergunta, constroem um mosaico de cenas por onde avança a relação entre os dois, e a história de um salgueiro-chorão será o seu fio condutor. A Memória da Árvore é um romance terno, construído de forma inteligente, que consegue colocar o leitor na pele de uma criança e que fala da transmissão de memórias, de como estas são fabricadas e conservadas, de onde se guardam e de como se podem perder.

Tilar J. Mazzeo,"Em plena Segunda Guerra, nos sussurros desesperados dos judeus, um nome passa de boca em boca: o de Irena Sendler, a jovem assistente social que está disposta a tudo para salvar as crianças judias dos campos de concentração. Quando, em 1942, Irena entrou no gueto de Varsóvia, o que viu dilacerou-lhe o coração. Ela sabia o destino de cada um dos judeus com quem se cruzava todos os dias. E foi incapaz de ficar indiferente. 
Começou a percorrer as ruas do gueto, bateu a todas as portas e pediu aos pais que lhe confiassem os seus filhos. Sob a vigilância apertada do regime nazi, Irena começou a levar as crianças para fora do gueto, e rumo à liberdade. Escondidas em caixões ou debaixo de sobretudos, em fuga pelo sistema de esgotos ou por passagens secretas entre edifícios, não havia nada que ela não estivesse disposta a fazer… 
Com a ajuda das mães, do seu amante judeu na Resistência, de amigos e vizinhos, Irena salvou cerca de 2500 crianças. Mas Irena fez mais ainda: manteve sempre um registo da verdadeira identidade de todos os meninos e meninas, para que um dia pudessem reencontrar os seus entes queridos. Receando ser descoberta, enterrou a lista sob uma macieira no jardim de uma amiga. Não podia imaginar que cerca de 90% das famílias dessas crianças não sobreviveria ao Holocausto. 
Irena Sendler correu riscos inimagináveis para salvar inocentes da barbárie nazi. É uma heroína da Segunda Guerra, considerada a versão feminina de Oskar Schindler. Foi nomeada para o Prémio Nobel da Paz em 2007, o ano que antecedeu a sua morte aos 98 anos. Esta obra é a devida homenagem à sua humanidade e bravura.

Thomas Mann,"Thomas Mann considerou esta monumental narrativa da história bíblica de José como a sua magnum opus. Concebeu-a em quatro partes - As Histórias de Jaacob, O Jovem José, José no Egito e José, o Provedor - como uma narrativa unificada, um romance mitológico da queda de José na escravidão e da sua ascensão a senhor do Egito. 
Baseado num profundo estudo da História, e utilizando detalhes pródigos e convincentes, Mann evoca o mundo mítico dos patriarcas e dos faraós, as antigas civilizações do Egito, da Mesopotâmia e da Palestina - com as suas divindades e rituais religiosos -, e a força universal do amor humano em toda a sua beleza, desespero, absurdo e dor.   
O resultado é uma brilhante amálgama de ironia, humor, emoção, perceção psicológica e grandeza épica. 
As Histórias de Jaacob, primeiro romance da tetralogia, foi publicado em 1933, o mesmo ano em que Mann se exilou da Alemanha devido à subida de Hitler ao poder. Nele, o autor reinterpreta as histórias de Jaacob - neto de Abraão e pai de José - usando em cada episódio a sua prosa mais experimental, e conferindo à obra um tom sereno tingido de ironia. 
Numa humanizadora abordagem às figuras mais lendárias da antiguidade, Mann dota Jaacob e José de todas as características e fraquezas dos homens, para oferecer uma emocionante resposta à crueldade do ser humano.

Teófilo Braga,"""No tempo do grande épico ainda se não tinha perdido o conhecimento da  relação de continuidade histórica entre Portugal e a antiga Lusitânia,  mais vasta e por isso mais violentamente retalhada pela administrarão  imperial romana. Esse conhecimento, embora confundido com as lendas  sincréticas dos falsos cronicões, influiu na consciência do nosso  individualismo étnico e nacional. O esforço de desnacionalização de  Portugal pela política da unificação ibérica, veio até reflectir-se nos  próprios historiadores pátrios, levando-os a considerar Portugal uma  formação recente, adventícia, sem individualidade, e a Lusitânia quase  como uma ficção banal dos eruditos da Renascença! Mas o carácter  persistente do tipo português, a resistência tenaz contra todos os  conflitos da natureza e pressões da vida, que tanto o distingue entre os  povos modernos, é a prova manifesta da raça lusitana como a descreveram  os geógrafos gregos e romanos. Nas lutas pela liberdade territorial a  Lusitânia deixou nos historiadores greco-latinos o eco da sua  resistência indomável, sobretudo no ciclo das guerras viriatinas, que se  reacenderam ainda sob o comando de Sertório.""Texto segundo o Novo Acordo Ortográfico.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Teofilo Braga\Viriato_ Narrativa epo-historica (1660)\cover.jpg,9789897001116,2014-01-05T13:51:28+00:00,Edições Vercial,3,,1.0,"Fiction, Historical, General, Autores Portugueses, Ancient World, Romance",Viriato: Narrativa epo-histórica,1660
Teófilo Braga,"Coletânea de contos com temas de paixões frenéticas, conducentes a suicídios, mortes, traições, renúncias extremas. Uma das primeiras incursões, feitas por um autor português, no universo da literatura fantástico-gótico, muito pouco validado em Portugal na altura. 
Estamos em plena Idade média. A noite era caliginosa e tétrica; o coriscar frequente dos relâmpagos, o ribombo estridente dos trovões repercutindo-se distante, e o restrugir medonho da floresta, completavam as harmonias intraduzíveis da tempestade.  
Anteriormente publicados no Jornal do Comércio e na Revista Contemporânea de Portugal e Brasil, estes ditos “contos góticos” de Teófilo Braga, refletem no autor uma direta influência de leituras de Hoffman e de EdgarAllan Poe, tal como o seu conhecimento da filosofia esotérica de Swedenborg. Apesar disso, poder-se-à dizer que estas primeiras (e únicas) incursões de Teófilo Braga neste estilo literário, não foram de todo bem sucedidas. E isso porque o autor tentou conciliar um tema com pouca vinculação na literatura da sua época, com os estilos românticos mais populares. Plenos de referências eruditas, estes contos refletem mais as leituras filosóficas do seu autor do que propriamente uma imaginação de artista e não correspondem exatamente ao género fantástico. No entanto estes contos trouxeram, entre nós, muitos aspetos inovadores, pela introdução na narrativa dos finais de 1800, de elementos como o estranho, o misterioso, o sinistro e o macabro.

With the consular election drawing near, Rome is fiercely divided between the conservative Cicero and the tempestuous Catilina, whose followers are rumored to be plotting a blood-thirsty siege for power if their leader fails to win office. 
Gordianus the Finder, retired to his Etruscan farm, is happy to be free of the intrigue and danger of the capital, but when his old friend Cicero enlists the Finder in an elaborate plot to control Catilina, Gordianus is drawn back into a familiar world. Now caught in a cloak-and-dagger political struggle for the fate of the Republic, Gordianus finds himself strangely drawn to the controversial candidate. Is Catilina really a subversive renegade, or are Cicero suspicions part of an even greater conspiracy? When a headless corpse ominously appears on his farm, Gordianus knows he must unlock the secret of *Catilina's Riddle* before Rome tears herself apart.

Before the night is out, he will be murdered. 
Now Gordianus begins his most dangerous case. Hired to investigate Dio's death by a beautiful woman with a scandalous reputation, he will follow a trail of political intrigue into the highest circles of power and the city's most hidden arenas of debauchery. There Gordianus will learn nothing is as it seems—not the damning evidence he uncovers, not the suspect he sends to trial, not even the real truth behind Dio's death which lies in secrets—not of state, but of the heart.

Steven Saylor & Maria José Marques de Figueiredo,"In this mystery set in Marseilles in 49 B.C., master detective Gordianus the Finder is on a personal quest to learn the truth about his missing son, Meto. Plunged into the midst of the bloody Roman civil war, the well-connected Gordianus and his son-in-law Davus survive adventure after adventure as they penetrate the Gaulic city Massilia, which is walled against Roman invasion. 
From the first pages, author Steven Saylor is on sure ground with his distinguished protagonist. Gordianus's careful, thoughtful musings are infused with real pathos as he seeks out information about his son whom, he has been informed, is dead. There is some speculation that Meto betrayed Caesar and that death was his punishment. Lacking a corpse, Gordianus cannot bring himself to believe that Meto is really dead. 
Indeed, bonds between fathers and children—their betrayals, promises, and legacies—play a key role in the twisting plot of *Last Seen in Massilia*. Literally the title refers to Meto, but the motif extends to other key characters as well. Apollonides, the imperious ruler of Massilia, has a peculiar bond with his horribly deformed daughter. The city's ""scapegoat"", Hieronymus, lives out the legacy of his parents' illegal double suicide by being the human repositor of Massilia's collective sins. He is expected to hurl himself from Sacrifice Rock to appease vengeful gods. 
Sacrifice Rock is central to the book, the site of a tussle between man and woman that ends, provocatively, in the woman's death. Was it suicide or murder? The three witnesses—Gordianus, Davus, and Hieronymus—are sharply divided on exactly what they saw. Gordianus pursues the truth of this mystery almost as a diversion from the more compelling mystery of his son's disappearance.

Both now turn to Egypt, where Pompey plans a last desperate stand on the banks of the Nile, while Caesar's legendary encounter with queen Cleopatra will spark a romance that reverberates down the centuries. But Egypt is a treacherous land, torn apart by the murderous rivalry between the goddess-queen and her brother King Ptolemy. 
Into this hot-house atmosphere of intrigue and deception comes Gordianus the Finder, innocently seeking a cure for his wife Bethesda in the sacred waters of the Nile. But when his plans go awry, he finds himself engaged in an even more desperate pursuit - to prove the innocence of the son he once disowned, who stands accused of murder. 
The judgment of Caesar will determine the fate of Gordianus's son; the choice Caesar makes between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy will determine the future of Rome's empire. At the center of these two dilemmas, Gordianus becomes the unwitting fulcrum that will shift the balance of history. Witness to the death throes of the old world, he is to play a critical role in the birth of the world to come. 
Drawing scrupulously on historical sources, this is the most ambitious novel yet in Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series.

Stacey Lannert,"A 4 de julho de 1990, Stacey Lannert, de dezoito anos, matou o pai. Ele abusava sexualmente dela desde os oito anos. Até então, Stacey sofrera em silêncio. Tudo mudou nessa noite, quando percebeu que a sua adorada irmã mais nova acabara de ser vítima do mesmo crime. Sem qualquer compaixão, o tribunal condenou-a a prisão perpétua. Stacey sente-se agora suficientemente forte para contar a história da sua infância arrepiante, durante a qual manteve a sanidade mental graças ao amor e ao instinto protetor que sentia pela irmã. Num tom comovente e digno, relata-nos também o que aconteceu quando deu entrada na prisão, esse momento de violência brutal que, inesperadamente, a fortaleceu e fez dela uma pessoa melhor. Decidida a não se vitimizar, Stacey encontrou em si mesma a força necessária para crescer e descobriu a importância e o poder curativo do amor. Quase dezanove anos depois, a 10 de janeiro de 2009, o governador do Missouri fez finalmente justiça. Passados seis dias, ela era uma mulher livre. Condenada é a história de como Stacey aprendeu a crescer e a conquistar a liberdade atrás das grades. É uma história de autodescoberta passada no universo paralelo de uma prisão de máxima segurança.

Søren Sveistrup,"O thriller do criador da série de culto The Killing  Uma tempestuosa manhã de Outubro. Num tranquilo subúrbio de Copenhaga, a Polícia faz uma descoberta terrível. No recreio de um colégio, uma jovem é encontrada brutalmente assassinada, e falta-lhe uma das mãos. Pendurado por cima dela, um pequeno boneco feito com castanhas. A jovem e ambiciosa detective Naia Thulin é designada para desvendar o caso. Com o seu colega Mark Hess, um investigador que acabou de ser expulso da Europol, descobrem uma misteriosa prova sobre ""o homem das castanhas"", nome com que os media baptizaram o assassino. Existem evidências que o ligam a uma menina que desapareceu um ano antes e foi dada como morta: a filha da ministra Rosa Hartung. Mas o homem que confessou o assassínio da menina, um jovem que sofre de uma doença mental, já está atrás das grades e o caso há muito tempo fechado. Quando uma segunda mulher é encontrada morta e, junto dela, mais um boneco de castanhas, Thulin e Hess suspeitam de que possa haver uma ligação entre o caso Hartung e as mulheres assassinadas. Mas qual é a relação entre as duas mortes? Thulin e Hess entram numa corrida contra o tempo. O assassino tem uma missão# e está longe de a terminar. Os elogios da crítica: «Excelente.

Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen & Pedro Sousa Tavares,"A personagem principal deste conto é Ruy, um rapaz que vive numa casa que não lhe parece ser sua. Há muitas regras, muitas rotinas, tantas que nem mesmo o jardim que rodeia a casa consegue ser suficientemente grande para que se sinta livre.  
Contudo, num daqueles dias de primavera que caem lentamente ao som do baloiçar das folhas, Ruy é surpreendido pelo rataplã de um tambor que o desafia a saltar o muro do jardim e a percorrer os campos até se abeirar de um acampamento de ciganos.   
Com eles acaba por ficar e, inspirado pelo espírito indomado de Gela, uma rapariga cigana de olhos cor de avelã, vai descobrir o prazer de sentir o chão debaixo dos pés, enfim, vai experimentar a liberdade pela qual sempre suspirou. 
Os Ciganos é um conto inédito de Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen localizado no seu espólio na primavera de 2009. Este conto encontrava-se inacabado, tendo Pedro Sousa Tavares, jornalista e neto da escritora, assumido a responsabilidade de continuar uma história sobre o irresistível apelo da liberdade, sobre a atração pelo que está fora dos muros e pela descoberta do outro e suas diferenças.  
A primeira parte do conto é da autoria de Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen e é apresentado a azul; a segunda, a preto, foi escrita por Pedro Sousa Tavares. Em comum, o notável trabalho de ilustração de Danuta Wojciechowska.  
O livro abre com uma Nota de Edição assinada por Maria Andresen de Sousa Tavares, que explica como surgiu a possibilidade de publicar este inédito; segue-se um texto de Pedro Sousa Tavares, no qual assume ter sido uma “ousadia” aceitar o desafio que lhe colocaram.

Numa ponte da cidade são encontrados os corpos sem vida de um casal de adolescentes. É uma tragédia de contornos invulgares. Rosa e Nikolai eram filhos de dois líderes do Kremlin, estudavam numa escola de elite, eram modelos de virtude. Estamos perante um crime? Um pacto suicida? Ou uma conspiração?

Várias crianças são feitas prisioneiras e obrigadas a testemunhar contra os pais e amigos. A pouco e pouco, são revelados os amores ilícitos e os segredos da alta sociedade de Moscovo, cruelmente exposta no seu esplendor e decadência.

Simon Sinek,"Poucas pessoas se lembram, mas a Creative Technology Ltd foi a empresa que lançou o primeiro mp3 do mercado. Para a história, porém, ficou o iPod, que a Apple só revelaria ao mundo quase dois anos mais tarde. Tirando o design e preço, os dois produtos equivaliam-se. Mas a filosofia dos seus criadores era radicalmente diferente. Enquanto a Creative vendia “apenas” um produto (um “leitor de mp3 com 5GB”), Steve Jobs vendia um sonho: “1000 canções no seu bolso”. Ou seja, a Creative falava das características técnicas do novo gadget enquanto a Apple disse-nos por que razão precisávamos dele.É esta a essência do extraordinário bestseller de Simon Sinek: mostrar até que ponto as pessoas, empresas e organizações tantas vezes se enganam ao pôr os “Quês” à frente dos “Porquês”. Se pensarmos bem, não é o que as empresas fazem que as diferencia, mas antes a paixão que as move. Uma mota pode ser só um veículo de duas rodas; mas se for uma Harley Davidson, significa já a entrada num clube.Simon Sinek – autor da terceira TedTalk mais vista – usa uma figura retirada da matemática, O Círculo Dourado, para demonstrar que as empresas e líderes de maior sucesso são aqueles que começam por questionar o porquê das suas ações.

Siba Shakib & Maria Nóvoa,"One woman’s harrowing story about life under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. 
Shirin-Gol was just a young girl when her village was levelled by the Russians in 1979. When the men in her family joined the resistance, she fled with the other women and children to Kabul, and so began a life of day-to-day struggle in her war-torn country. 
A life that included a Pakistani refugee camp, a forced marriage to pay off her brother’s gambling debts, selling her body and begging for money to feed her growing family, an attempted suicide and an unsuccessful attempt to leave Afghanistan for Iran after the Taliban seized control of her country. 
This is the story of the fate of many women in Afghanistan. But it is also a story of a courageous and proud woman who refused to be banished to a life behind the walls of her house, who wanted an education for her children so that they could have a chance to live their lives without fear and poverty.

Quando o marido de Cora Seaborne morre, a viúva inicia uma nova vida marcada ao mesmo tempo por alívio e tristeza. Não teve um casamento feliz e ela própria nunca se adequou ao papel de mulher da sociedade. Acompanhada pelo filho, Francis - um rapaz curioso e obsessivo -, troca a cidade pelo campo de Essex, onde espera que o ar fresco e os grandes espaços lhe proporcionem o refúgio de que necessita. Quando se instalam em Colchester, chegam-lhe aos ouvidos rumores de que a Serpente do Essex, conhecida por em tempos ter percorrido os pântanos na sua avidez de colher vidas humanas, regressou à aldeia de Aldwinter. Cora, naturalista amadora sem interesse por superstições ou questões religiosas, fica empolgada com a ideia de que aquilo que as pessoas da região tomam por uma criatura sobrenatural possa, na realidade, ser uma espécie ainda por descobrir. Quando decide iniciar a sua investigação é apresentada ao vigário de Aldwinter, William Ransome. Tal como Cora, Will sente uma desconfiança profunda em relação aos boatos, que considera um fenómeno de terror de caráter moral e um desvio da verdadeira fé. Enquanto Will procura tranquilizar os paroquianos, inicia-se entre ele e Cora uma relação intensa; apesar de os dois não concordarem a respeito de nada, são atraídos e afastados um do outro inexoravelmente, a ponto de isso modificar a vida de ambos de formas inesperadas. Escrito com uma delicadeza e uma inteligência cheias de requinte, este romance é sobretudo uma celebração do amor e das muitas formas que ele pode assumir.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Sarah Perry\A Serpente do Essex (1719)\cover.jpg,9789898866035,2018-11-29T13:31:08+00:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction, Autores Estrangeiros",A Serpente do Essex,1719

Willa Jackson vem de uma antiga família que ficou arruinada gerações antes. A mansão Blue Ridge Madam, construída pelo bisavô de Willa durante a época área de Walls of Water, e outrora a mais grandiosa casa da cidade, foi durante anos um monumento solitário à infelicidade e ao escândalo.

Talvez, por fim, o passado possa ser deixado para trás enquanto algo novo e maravilhoso se ergue das suas cinzas. Mas o que se ergue, afinal, é um esqueleto, encontrado sob o solitário pessegueiro da propriedade, que com certeza irá fazer surgir coisas terríveis.

‘Malone’, writes Malone, ‘is what I am called now.’ On his deathbed, whittling away the time with stories and revisions of stories, the octogenarian Malone's account of his condition is contradictory and intermittent, shifting with the vagaries of the passing days: without mellowness, without elegiacs; wittier, jauntier, and capable of darker rages than his precursor Molloy.

Indissociavelmente ligada à sua nação, a história de Saleem é um turbilhão de desastres e triunfos que espelha o percurso da Índia moderna na sua forma mais impossível e gloriosa. Publicado em 1981, Os Filhos da Meia-Noite, segundo romance de Rushdie, não só deu notoriedade ao seu autor como se tornou num fenómeno de êxito literário. A sua adaptação ao cinema é o resultado da colaboração da realizadora Deepa Mehta com o próprio Salman Rushdie, que não só escreveu o argumento como dá também voz ao narrador.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Salman Rushdie\Os Filhos da Meia-Noite (1740)\cover.jpg,9789722053457,1981-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,Publicações Dom Quixote,4,,1.0,"Classics, Fantasy",Os Filhos da Meia-Noite,1740

Salman Rushdie,"No dia 14 de Fevereiro de 1989, Dia dos Namorados, Salman recebeu um telefonema de uma jornalista da BBC a dizer-lhe que fora «condenado à morte» pelo aiatola Khomeini. Era a primeira vez que ouvia a palavra fatwa. O seu crime? Ter escrito um romance intitulado Os Versículos Satânicos, que era acusado de ser «contra o Islão, o Profeta e o Alcorão». Assim começa a extraordinária história de um escritor obrigado a passar à clandestinidade, mudando de casa para casa, com a presença constante de uma equipa de proteção policial armada. Pediram-lhe que escolhesse um pseudónimo pelo qual a polícia pudesse tratá-lo. Ele pensou nos escritores de que mais gostava e em combinações dos seus nomes; ocorreram-lhe então Conrad e Tchékhov - Joseph Anton. Como vivem um escritor e a sua família com a ameaça de assassínio durante mais de nove anos? Como continua ele a trabalhar? Como se apaixona e desapaixona? Como é que o desespero molda os seus pensamentos e acções, como e porquê tropeça, como aprende a ripostar? Nestas notáveis memórias, Rushdie narra pela primeira vez essa história: a história de uma das batalhas cruciais do nosso tempo pela liberdade de expressão. Fala das realidades, umas vezes sinistras, outras cómicas, da coabitação com polícias armados e dos estreitos laços que se forjaram com os seus protetores; da sua luta para obter o apoio e a compreensão de governos, chefes de serviços de informações, editores, jornalistas e colegas escritores; e de como recuperou a liberdade. Este é um livro de excecional franqueza e honestidade, empolgante, provocatório, comovente e de vital importância.

Vítima da negligência da mãe, tem nos moradores do extravagante Bairro Francês os seus maiores aliados. De Cokie, humilde e fiel; a Willie, a dona de um bordel cuja frieza esconde um coração de ouro; e a Jesse, tímido, atraente e eternamente apaixonado, todos a protegem e velam por ela.

Aqui, entre as estantes repletas de livros, no pequeno escritório que agora lhe serve de quarto, não tem de se defender da sua própria mãe nem fingir ser a durona solitária que domina as ruas. Ao anoitecer, quando a porta se fecha e as luzes se apagam, ela descobre nas páginas que folheia a imensidão do mundo e anseia por uma vida melhor.

Robert Skidelsky & Edward Skidelsky,"Em 1930, John Maynard Keynes previu que, no espaço de um século, o rendimento per capita aumentaria de forma constante, as necessidades básicas das pessoas seriam satisfeitas e ninguém teria de trabalhar mais de 15 horas por semana ¿ claramente estava errado.

Gémeos Rivais, romance de Robert Ludlum, publicado em 1976, esteve mais de dezasseis semanas na lista dos bestsellers do New York Times, e recebeu da crítica um acolhimento entusiástico. Assim, o San Diego Union disse desta obra de Ludlum: ""Um trabalho de mestre... O seu romance mais complexo, o mais que obriga a pensar e o de mais intricado enredo até à data."" ""O romance mais ambicioso... e também o seu melhor livro. Os seus meandros e reviravoltas transportam o leitor por uma veloz pista de trenó de competição... Uma imaginação maravilhosamente infatigável"", assim se referiu o New York Times. A United Press International exultava: ""Um triunfo... Abarca praticamente quatro décadas, misturando nazis, espionagem, romance, sangue, política e religião… Um daqueles livros que a pessoa pensa interromper passado um capítulo... e dá consigo às duas horas da manhã com ele lido de fio a pavio."" 
Um livro que se lê de um só fôlego. Poucos escritores se podem vangloriar de terem atingido uma tão fulminante popularidade como Robert Ludlum, visto que cada um dos seus romances se transforma de imediato num êxito de vendas.

Robert A. Heinlein,"Editora responsável por publicar grandes clássicos da ficção científica, a Aleph traz de volta ao Brasil Um Estranho Numa Terra Estranha, romance escrito em 1961 pelo premiado autor, Robert Heinlein. Em uma edição inédita, o livro chega ao leitor com nova tradução e prefácio escrito por Neil Gaiman – autor de Sandman e Deuses Americanos – explicando a importância da publicação e a influência em seu trabalho. Vencedor do prêmio Hugo de 1962, Um Estranho Numa Terra Estranha traz a história de Valentine Michael Smith, um humano criado em Marte. Ao ser trazido à Terra, ele entra em contato pela primeira vez com seus iguais e se esforça para entender os costumes, a moral e as regras sociais que definem os estranhos terráqueos. Em meio a diversas barreiras, o homem de Marte se esforça para grokar (termo em marciano, criado pelo autor, com diversos significados, como: beber, sentir, aprender e fazer parte) esse mundo tão alienígena a ele, enquanto procura explicar à humanidade seus próprios conceitos fundamentais, bem como suas concepções de amor e respeito. No romance, o leitor irá se deparar com os mais diversos tópicos de discussão: desde o amor livre, passando por críticas ao consumismo e até às instituições cristãs. A obra é vista como uma afronta ao moralismo e à cultura da época e, graças à sua mensagem de liberdade, tornou-se um manifesto do movimento hippie da década de 1970. É quase inevitável não fazer uma comparação com Tropas Estelares, também escrito por Heinlein. Enquanto Tropas, lançado em 1959, apresenta um viés mais militarista e conservador, Um Estranho Numa Terra Estranha, lançado dois anos depois, chegou ao público repleto de críticas sociais, hedonismo, e uma clara insatisfação com a cultura de sua época.

Benjamin recusa-se a falar do passado, procurando as respostas na cabala, que estuda com avidez, em busca daquilo a que chama os fios invisíveis que tudo ligam. E Shelly refugia-se numa hipersexualidade, seu único subterfúgio para calar os fantasmas que o atormentam.

Milhares de judeus, que já haviam sido convertidos à força ao catolicismo, são perseguidos por fanáticos religiosos que os acusam de atrair a seca e a peste que assolam Portugal, prenúncio de uma época de perseguição religiosa instaurada pela Inquisição.

Richard Zimler,"A vida de Teresa muda radicalmente quando os pais deixam Lisboa para irem viver em Nova Iorque. Não estando preparada para a vida na América, com dificuldade para se exprimir em inglês, Teresa encontra refúgio no seu particular sentido de humor e no único amigo, Angel, um rapaz brasileiro de 16 anos, bonito, mas desastrado, que adora John Lennon e a sua música. Mas o mundo de Teresa desmorona-se completamente quando o pai morre e a deixa, a ela e ao irmão mais novo, com uma mãe negligente e consumista.  
Os problemas de Teresa confluem para um clímax de desespero no dia 8 de Dezembro de 2009 - aniversário da morte de John Lennon - quando ela e Angel fazem uma peregrinação ao Memorial Strawberry Fields Forever em Central Park. Aí, um terrível acontecimento que nunca poderia ter previsto devolve-a à vida e ao amor.  
Em Ilha Teresa, Richard Zimler conta-nos num estilo inteligente, irreverente e com uma certa dose de humor negro a história de Teresa, uma rapariga de 15 anos, sensível e espirituosa, cujo equilíbrio e sentido de identidade se vêem ameaçados quando a sua família deixa Lisboa para ir viver nos subúrbios de Nova Iorque.  
Num registo um pouco diferente do habitual, mas igualmente brilhante, Richard Zimler continua a maravilhar-nos pela forma convincente como nos transporta para o admirável mundo das suas personagens. 
Críticas de imprensa  
«Num registo bastante diferente do que tem habituado os seus leitores, Zimmler constrói uma história verosímil – onde nem faltam menções a assuntos da atualidade noticiosa como o processo Casa Pia ou a anteriores romances seus como Os Anagramas de Varsóvia – que agarra o leitor desde as primeiras páginas.»  
Ana Paula Gouveia 
«Teresa é a metáfora que serve a Zimler para falar da diferença e do estigma. [.. ]E a “Ilha Teresa” não é mais do que Teresa, do princípio do fim, no seu de isolamento, no modo de interpelar o que a rodeia. Sarcástica, cruel, inconformada, irmã protectora do pequeno Pedro, de sete anos. Teresa que não entende e quer entender tanta coisa, uma personagem feminina de uma densidade capaz de a fazer sobreviver a um romance marcado pela sensibilidade e a sensação de partilha de algo proibido de tão íntimo que é. Nós temos o privilégio de entrar nessa intimidade através da voz do inconfessável, a voz de Teresa. Como cúmplices de um segredo. Amargo e cheio de ironia.»

XVI, a Inquisição fazia enormes progressos na sua missão de impedir todos os 'bruxos' - quer fossem nativos hindus, quer imigrantes judeus - de praticarem as suas crenças tradicionais. Os que se recusavam a denunciar outros ou a renunciar à sua fé eram estrangulados por carrascos ou queimados em autos-de-fé.

Tiago e a irmã, Sofia, gozam uma infância tranquila, aprendendo com o pai a ilustrar manuscritos e mergulhando no caos inebriante das festividades hindus celebradas pela sua amada cozinheira Nupi.

Numa noite de Inverno, numa estrada remota do Nebrasca, Mark Schlutter, sofre um acidente quase fatal. A sua irmã Karin regressa à sua cidade natal para tomar conta de Mark. Porém, ao despertar de um prolongado coma, Mark acredita que esta mulher — que se assemelha, age e fala como a sua irmã — é, na verdade, uma impostora. Magoada pela recusa do irmão em reconhecê-la, Karin contacta o neurologista Gerald Weber, famoso pelas suas investigações sobre o mundo infinitamente bizarro dos distúrbios cerebrais. Weber acredita que Mark sofre de uma perturbação rara conhecida como síndrome de Capgras — a ilusão de que as pessoas que nos rodeiam são impostores. 
O que o médico descobre em Mark mina lentamente as suas próprias noções sobre o «eu». Entretanto, Mark, armado apenas de um bilhete deixado por uma testemunha anónima, tenta descobrir o que aconteceu na noite do seu inexplicável acidente. A verdade sobre essa noite mudará profunda e inalteravelmente a vida dos três. 
O Eco da Memória é um cativante mistério que explora o poder e os limites da inteligência humana.

As outras foram educadas, desde pequenas, a cumprir a sua missão: ir para o mar e trazer o alimento. E é o que fazem, dia após dia, desde sempre. Sem nunca se questionarem por quê. Fernão não percebe. Ele voa por prazer, voa cada vez melhor, e sabe que o voo, em si mesmo, é um dom único. E, aos poucos, desafiando as rígidas regras do Bando, assume o seu desejo de se aperfeiçoar, de usar melhor esse fantástico poder de voar. E procura ir sempre cada vez mais rápido, cada vez mais longe, até onde as asas o levarem – levando as suas experiências ao limite e arriscando a própria vida. Mas o Bando não vê com bons olhos aquelas aventuras.

Raul Germano Brandão,"Para se criar é preciso sofrer-se. Hoje e sempre só a dor é que deu vida às coisas inanimadas. Com um escopro e um tronco inerte faz-se uma obra admirável, se o escultor sofreu. Mais: com palavras, com sons perdidos, com imaterialidades, consegue-se este milagre: fazer rir, fazer sonhar, arrancar lágrimas a outras criaturas. Com as simples e secas letras do abecedário, um desgraçado com génio, metido numa água-furtada, edifica uma coisa eterna, uma construção mais sólida e mais bela, do que se fosse arrancar os materiais ao coração das montanhas. 
O que é então a dor, milagre extraordinário, que consegue dar vida às fragas? o que é esse assombroso fluido, que se comunica, alma arrancada da própria alma e que se pode repartir como o pão? Nunca houve sob o sol criatura que sofresse da verdadeira dor cujo sofrimento não consolasse ou salvasse. Até as mais humildes, tal como árvores que ainda depois de mirradas, vão aquecer e alumiar os pobres. 
A dor dá a vida e não é a própria vida: cria, redime, obra prodígios e nada há que se comunique, que convença, que torne os homens irmãos, como ela… Para onde vão pois todos esses gritos, unidos num só grito? Visto que nada se perde, que é que se sustenta no infinito com essa enxurrada de lágrimas? Deus? 
Por muito tempo escutei o ruído de vozes, de exasperos, de gritos de criaturas. Vinham da guerra, do Hospital, da miséria humana. 
E desse mar espezinhado nasciam clarões, as nebulosas donde surgem mundos. Esse eterno rio de gritos, a correr desde que o homem existe, vai desaguar no infinito. 
É que a dor é a única força que verdadeiramente cria e destrói: é a Força. Alimenta Deus e o limo. É um atlântico de fogo, é o espírito do universo. Cria claridades na alma dos desgraçados e faz nascer montanhas.

Raul Brandão,"<http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/humus/>
A obra-prima de Raul Brandão, é o primeiro romance existencialista português que inclui traços do expressionismo literário. Trata-se de um romance-monólogo, centrado em dois monólogos interiores: o primeiro orador, sem nome, e o seu alter-ego – um filósofo lunático chamado “Gabiru”. Ambos registam a vida que decorre numa pequena vila, ao longo de um ano, exprimindo o que veem e o que sentem, em perspetivas diferentes, expondo assim a contradição entre o mundo aparente e o autêntico. 
Nos alicerces uma geração, outra geração, todos apodrecendo juntos na mesma terra misturada e revolvida. A parte exterior é maravilhosa, a parte subterrânea é mais maravilhosa ainda. É a única raiz que se conserva intacta. 
Publicado pela primeira vez em 1917 e escrito durante a primeira Grande Guerra (1914-1918), “Húmus” é a primeira obra portuguesa de carácter existencialista – um movimento tornado popular durante o século XX em plena convulsão das guerras mundiais, como maneira de reafirmar a importância da liberdade e individualidade humana, em abordagens sobre a angústia existencial, a existência de Deus, a vida e a consciência. 
O título da obra, “Húmus” – o composto de detritos vegetais e animais, a parte fértil do solo, onde todos apodrecem “juntos na mesma terra misturada e revolvida”, como o próprio autor o refere – é o ponto de partida para uma análise temática sobre a morte e a regeneração da vida, numa perpétua continuidade. Temas muito próprios do existencialismo que se debruça sobre o sentido da existência da humanidade, ao mesmo tempo que a define. 
Quando saiu, a obra foi veementemente rejeitada tanto pelo público como pelos críticos literários da altura. Foi definida por muitos como sendo desnecessariamente complexa, sem uma estrutura narrativa concreta e impossível de catalogar. Realmente, o “Húmus”, não tendo os pressupostos necessários para ser um verdadeiro romance, também não é um ensaio nem é um diário embora esteja escrito nesse formato. Houve alguém que a definisse com “um poema contínuo” por ser quase um texto lírico, com questões filosóficas, mas escrito em prosa. 
Apesar da má receção do público a obra teve um grande impacto nos meios literários, tanto que Raul Brandão passaria a ser apelidado como “o autor do Húmus”, apesar de escrever outras obras de grande aclamação e sucesso literário. Nada faria prever na altura que essa mesma obra era apenas o começo de um novo movimento literário e que influenciaria toda uma geração de novos escritores como Agustina Bessa Luís, Virgílio Ferreira, António Lobo Antunes ou José Saramago. 
O poeta e ensaísta David Mourão-Ferreira escreveria sobre o Húmus, anos mais tarde: “Acabo de reler o ‘Húmus’, de um fôlego, numa só noite, e dessa leitura saio, ao mesmo tempo, sufocado e eufórico, impregnado até aos ossos de uma sensação física de ‘mixórdia’ e de espanto.”

Raul Brandão,"Uma das mais curtas e belas obras de Raul Brandão sobre o amor trágico, por onde desfilam as mais extrínsecas personagens do mundo circense que, pelas suas discussões e ações, levantam questões filosóficas acerca do sonho e da vida mundana, do correcto ou incorrecto, da vida e da morte. 
K. Maurício é um palhaço de circo que adora fazer rir as pessoas, tornando-as felizes. Durante as suas atuações, em cada gesto ou palavra, exprime o seu estado de espírito e a sua vida fantasiosa e faz isto perfeitamente porque vive num constante mundo de sonho, sem dar importância ao que é mundano. Um dia apaixona-se por Camélia, uma trapezista, mas ao exprimir o seu amor, expondo os seus sentimentos como costuma fazer nas suas atuações, apercebe-se que Camélia apenas se ri das suas lágrimas e dos seus sentimentos. Isto acaba por leva-lo ao desespero e a cometer actos encabeçados pelo ciúme. 
A obra foi publicada pela primeira vez em 1896 sob o título de “História d’um Palhaço (A Vida e o Diário de K. Maurício)” na qual incluía duas partes: A história trágica do Palhaço contada na terceira pessoa; e um diário, contado na primeira pessoa, sobre as reflexões pessoais do protagonista durante o desenrolar dos acontecimentos da primeira parte – Este tipo de estrutura narrativa torna-a numa obra vanguardista para a época em que foi pela primeira vez publicada.

José Duarte Ramalho Ortigão,"Assim como quatro quintas partes do corpo humano são água, assim quatro quintas partes da grande corpulência do globo são mar. Parecendo separar os homens, o belo destino eterno do mar é reuni-los. 
A bacia do Mediterrâneo confinava o mundo antigo habitado pelos gregos, pelos fenícios e pelos egípcios. Foi pelo Mediterrâneo que partiram as primeiras colónias que povoaram a África e a Ásia, estabelecendo o princípio das nossas relações com o mundo novo. No Egipto, na Pentapotâmia e na China as primitivas civilizações seguiram, segundo Humboldt, o curso dos rios e baixaram dos montes ao litoral. Na Fenícia, na Grécia, as primeiras expedições marítimas iniciaram os nossos domínios sobre as forças da natureza. 
De tal modo o mar foi o primeiro guia da humanidade.

Rachel Hollis,"Pára de acreditar nas mentiras que contas a ti própria e torna-te na pessoa que queres mesmo ser.“Alguma vez acreditaste que não és suficientemente boa? Que não és suficientemente magra? Que não és digna de ser amada? Que és uma má mãe? Tudo mentiras.” Este livro é sobre mentiras. Não daquelas que dizemos umas às outras, mas sim das que contamos a nós próprias. Rachel Hollis, 35 anos, mãe de quatro filhos, contou-as todas: “Não sou suficientemente boa.” “Sou má na cama.” “Não sei como ser mãe.” Hoje, a fundadora do site de lifestyle TheChicSite.com e CCO da sua própria empresa, sabe que se andou a enganar durante anos. E percebeu pela reação de milhões de fãs que não estava sozinha. A sua presença online, onde admite corajosamente as suas inseguranças, teve um eco profundo em mulheres de todo o mundo. A pensar nelas, decidiu escrever um livro com vinte capítulos, um para cada uma das falsas crenças que teve de ultrapassar. Justifica cada mentira com histórias suas, desde a sua primeira maratona ao vestido que levou à noite dos Óscares, para mostrar como aprendeu a olhar para si mesma e a aceitar-se. Em tudo, sim, até naquelas estrias na barriga que conquistou a cada filho nascido – e que exibe sem medo no seu Instagram. E, no final de cada “mentira”, resume as técnicas e estratagemas que usou para seguir em frente. Afinal ela é igual a todas as outras mulheres.

Possidónio Cachapa,"Publicado pela primeira vez em 1998, e traduzido para várias línguas, Materna Doçura foi uma pedrada no charco, um anúncio de frescura na literatura portuguesa, que conquistou a crítica e milhares de leitores. Ninguém sai ileso de um grande amor. Ninguém fica indiferente a uma história como esta.  ""A mãe é uma doce prisão."" Perder tragicamente a mãe, Sacha entra numa busca desequilibrada para reencontrar a sua imagem no corpo e rosto de todas as mulheres. Viajando das ruas luminosas de Lisboa aos corredores escuros do metro parisiense, o protagonista perseguirá a figura maternal de forma obsessiva. Tem um buraco no peito que precisa desesperadamente preencher. Um pai inesperado, prostitutas de coração grande e produtores de cinema capazes de verem para lá do imediato, são algumas das personagens inusitadas que se cruzarão no caminho de Sacha, num universo em que as mulheres podem abraçar um lado masculino e os homens deixar bater um coração de mulher. Materna Doçura é um romance sobre o amor materno, mas, ao mesmo tempo, um manifesto sobre a importância de olhar todas as pessoas com compaixão e respeito. Escrito com irreverência e imaginação, leva o leitor da primeira à última página com uma voracidade feita de humor, emoção e drama. Neste livro, ninguém se perde, mesmo aqueles que deixaram a luz para trás, há muito. Personagens ou leitores. Os elogios da crítica: «Materna Doçura, romance de estreia de Possidónio Cachapa, é uma espécie de prisma de fim de milénio de onde irradia, poderosa, a insólita história de Sacha G., um filho obcecado pela mãe. Entrada fulminante na ficção portuguesa.» Público «Falar de Materna Doçura não é fácil. O livro não se lê, devora-se avidamente. Mas o embate inicial tem um efeito no mínimo paralisante, que vai do arrepio das primeiras páginas à emoção, em crescendo, que o leitor vai estando consciente de experimentar à medida que avança pelos meandros de uma história singular.» Expresso «Para muitos leitores, Materna Doçura, inolvidável romance de estreia de P. Cachapa, foi o Cú de Judas da década de 90, e muitos não hesitaram então - nós entre eles -, em augurar a P. Cachapa um futuro auspicioso semelhante ao que a década de 90 trouxe a Lobo Antunes.» Jornal de Letras «Materna Doçura é um romance a sério, magistralmente escrito e contado, onde se prefere a ternura ao escândalo.» Diário de Notícias «Uma fluidez na construção efabuladora do enredo, a pausada apresentação das personagens e um ritmado andamento dos diálogos entrecortados transforma este romance numa leitura singularmente devoradora de umas breves horas.» O Independente «A arte de Possidónio Cachapa consiste no modo como presentifica os seres e as coisas.» Urbano Tavares Rodrigues «Possidónio Cachapa arrebata com Eu sou a árvore.

Now she is returning home for the first time to Virginia's eastern shores and the ancestral house where her mother fell down to her death on the front steps twenty-five years ago. Though Susan has little memory of the accident, her arrival has alarmed those who fear what may lie dormant in Susan's memory. But it is her maternal grandmother, Alex Montoro, a proud, intense, aging doyenne of the ballet, who believes that her memory must be unlocked, since Susan is the only living witness to the tragedy--and Alex suspects that her daughter's fall was no accident. Once unlocked, Susan's memory could hold the key for solving what Alex believes to be an unsolved mystery.

Philip Roth,"O novo romance de Philip Roth é uma história iniludivelmente íntima, embora universal, de perda, arrependimento e estoicismo. O autor de sucessos editoriais como A Conspiração contra a América, desvia agora a sua atenção do «encontro pungente de uma família com a história»(New York Times) para a vida de combate de um homem contra a mortalidade. O destino do homem de Roth (everyman) é traçado logo a partir do primeiro e chocante confronto deste com a morte, nas praias idílicas dos seus verões de infância, passando pelas provações familiares e pelos sucessos profissionais da sua vigorosa idade adulta e terminando na velhice, em que se sente dilacerado pela decadência dos seus contemporâneos e perseguido pelos seus próprios padecimentos físicos. Criativo de sucesso numa agência de publicidade de Nova Iorque, é pai de dois filhos, de um primeiro casamento, que o desprezam, e de uma filha, de um segundo casamento, que o adora. É o irmão querido de um bom homem, cuja boa forma física virá a despertar nele uma amarga inveja, e é o solitário ex-marido de três mulheres muito diferentes com quem teve casamentos desastrosos. É, afinal, um homem que se tornou naquilo que não quer ser. Todo-o-Mundo vai buscar o seu título a uma peça teatral alegórica de um autor anónimo do século xv, um clássico da dramaturgia inglesa antiga, que tem por tema a chamada dos vivos à presença da morte.Philip Roth ganhou o Prémio Pulitzer com Pastoral Americana em 1997. Em 1998 recebeu a Medalha Nacional de Artes da Casa Branca e, em 2002, o mais alto galardão da Academia Americana de Artes e Letras, a Medalha de Ouro da Ficção, anteriormente atribuída a John dos Passos, William Faulkner e Saul Bellow, entre outros. Ganhou três vezes o PEN/Faulkner Award e o National Book Critics Award. Em 2005 A Conspiração contra a América recebeu o prémio da Sociedade de historiadores Americanos pelo «excecional romance histórico sobre um tema americano, relativo a 2003-2004». Roth recebeu dois dos mais prestigiados prémios do PEN: em 2006, o PEN/Nabokov «pelo conjunto da obra [...] de originalidade constante e artisticamente perfeita» e, em 2007, o PEN/Saul Bellow de Consagração na Ficção Americana, dado ao escritor cujo apuro ao longo de uma carreira sustentada o coloca ao mais alto nível da literatura americana. Roth é o único escritor americano vivo a ter a obra publicada numa edição completa e definitiva pela Library of America. Em 2011 Roth recebeu o Man Booker International Prize. Foi o quarto autor a receber esta distinção.

Os Factos é a autobiografia nada convencional de um escritor que mudou o nosso modo de ver a ficção – uma obra de irresistível franqueza e criatividade, particularmente instrutiva na revelação das interações entre a vida e a arte.Em Os Factos, Philip Roth concentra-se em cinco episódios da sua vida: a infância urbana e protegida, nos anos trinta e quarenta; a preparação para a vida americana numa universidade conservadora, nos anos cinquenta; o envolvimento tumultuoso, quando era jovem e ambicioso, com a pessoa mais colérica que conheceu em toda a sua vida (a «rapariga dos meus sonhos», como Roth lhe chama); o choque frontal com um influente grupo de judeus indignados com o seu Goodbye, Columbus; e a descoberta, nos excessos dos anos sessenta, de um lado inexplorado do seu talento que o levou a escrever O Complexo de Portnoy.O livro termina surpreendentemente – à boa maneira de Roth – com um ataque feroz do romancista às suas competências como autobiógrafo.Philip Roth ganhou o Prémio Pulitzer com Pastoral Americana em 1997.

Philip Roth,"Como Rip Van Winkle, que regressa àsua cidade natal e encontra tudo mudado, Nathan Zuckerman volta a Nova Iorque, a cidade que abandonou há onze anos. Sozinho na sua montanha da Nova Inglaterra, Nathan Zuckerman foi exclusivamente escritor: sem vozes, sem jornais nem televisão sem ameaças terroristas, sem mulheres, sem notícias, sem outras ocupações que não fossem trabalhar e enfrentar a velhice. 
Percorrendo as ruas como uma alma penada, depressa estabelece três relações que fazem explodir a sua solidão tão cuidadosamente protegida. Uma é com um jovem casal com o qual, num momento irreflectido, se propõe fazer uma permuta de casas. Eles trocarão a Manhattan do pós 11 de Setembro pelo seu refúgio no interior e ele regressará à vida urbana. Mas a partir do momento em que os conhece, Zuckerman quer também trocar a sua solidão pelo desafio erótico da jovem mulher, Jamie, que o atrai a ponto de o fazer voltar a tudo quanto pensava ter deixado para trás: a intimidade, o jogo vibrante do coração e do corpo.  
A segunda relação é com uma figura da juventude de Zuckerman, Amy Bellette, companheira e musa do primeiro herói literário de Zuckerman, E.I. Lonoff. Outrora irresistível, Amy é agora uma velha minada pela doença, guardiã da memória desse escritor americano de nobre austeridade que apontou a Nathan o caminho solitário para uma vocação de escritor. 
A terceira relação é com o aspirante a biógrafo de Lonoff, um jovem mastim literário, pronto a fazer e dizer praticamente tudo o que for preciso para chegar ao «grande segredo» de Lonoff. 
Subitamente envolvido, como nunca desejou ou tencionou voltar a estar, com o amor, a dor, o desejo e o ressentimento, Zuckerman representa um drama interior de possibilidades estimulantes e irresistíveis.

Pedro Vieira,"Um retrato cru e épico do Portugal do século XX pela mão de um dos romancistas mais promissores da literatura portuguesa contemporânea.  Cabe quase tudo num século de vida de um povo. Naufrágios e glórias, luz e trevas, gente levantada e de joelhos. E, durante todos esses anos, a maré sobe e desce. Há um país que se vai transformando, mesmo visto de longe. Há homens em fuga para a frente, que trocam de nome e de moral. Há mulheres de dentes cerrados. Há filhos deixados para trás. Meadas de histórias e de sangues às quais se perdeu o fio.Num romance sem heróis, onde todos lutam, sobrevivem e morrem a tentar ser livres, é possível, embora vão, tentar destrinçar, no meio do medo e da culpa, onde acaba a ficção e começa a realidade. E se, por vezes, a intimidade da escrita nos aproxima de acontecimentos distantes, noutros, é a frieza da narrativa que resguarda momentos de grande profundidade.Maré alta é um retrato cru e épico do Portugal do século XX e de quem o viveu, no limiar onde a esperança, o sonho e a memória se confundem e perdem na sucessão de marés. Um século é muito tempo. Um século não é nada, quando aprendemos a nadar. Os elogios da crítica: Sobre a obra de Pedro Vieira «Última Paragem, Massamá é um romance de aprendizagem na linha de Nome de Guerra (1938), de Almada Negreiros, ou Os Três Seios de Novélia (1968), de Manuel da Silva Ramos. Dito de outro modo, narrativa pulverizada da cidade mítica. [#] À Lisboa do primeiro modernismo (twenties) e da guerra colonial (sixties), Vieira contrapõe a geração dos diplomados de call-center: [#] Respiração sincopada, jargão conforme.»Eduardo Pitta, Público «Pedro Vieira é um repórter nato, com poderes de observação e empatia raros e com uma especial atenção ao uso da língua portuguesa. Há uma verdadeira compulsão em anotar todas as expressões, clichés, corruptelas, bem como a novilíngua anglicizada. Da gestão à religião, passando pelas latitudes travestidas de sabedoria, é um festim da oralidade caótica, bizarra, inventiva, hilariante ou poética.""Pedro Mexia, Expresso, (sobre Última paragem: Massamá) «Um retrato inovador de um tempo e das linguagens que o dominam. Um tempo muito presente de que cada leitor se sente parte. Somos nós nesta voragem.» Isabel Lucas, Público (sobre O que não pode ser salvo) «Fazem falta, na ficção portuguesa contemporânea, romances capazes de captar o momento presente, os impactos da crise económica na sociedade, o modo como os portugueses viveram (ou sobreviveram) nestes últimos anos de austeridade. A literatura é uma arte lenta, mas felizmente há autores que a aceleram e conseguem sintonizá-la com a atualidade. (#) Se no seu primeiro romance, Última Paragem: Massamá, Vieira oferecia-nos uma visão desencantada da vida nos subúrbios, centrada no eixo formado pela Linha de Sintra, agora o objetivo é muito mais abrangente.» José Mário Silva, Expresso (sobre O que não pode ser salvo) «Como numa tragédia, há uma espécie de força negra que impele as personagens a uma condenação. Não se trata de uma visão determinística, mas da lucidez de um pessimismo atento. A precipitação final do livro aproxima-o da catástrofe trágica, acabando por lhe dar uma dimensão que o eleva acima de uma simples narrativa.»Hugo Pinto Santos, Time Out (sobre O que não pode ser salvo) «Com efeito, não existe passado literário em Portugal para o estilo de Pedro Vieira, o qual não se resume a adornar a narração de uma história, uma simples história (pecado maior do atual romance português),mas, tal como o de Raul Brandão e o de Lobo Antunes, a evidenciar, por meio da caracterização das personagens, segundo uma leitura satírica, traços fundamentais da cultura portuguesa e docomportamento idiossincrático dos portugueses, revolucionados neste princípio de século.»Miguel Real, Jornal de Letras (sobre O que não pode ser salvo)",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Pedro Vieira\Mare alta (1849)\cover.jpg,9789896657543,2019-02-21T13:07:34+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Fiction, General",Maré alta,1849

Ao contrário dos livros de auto-ajuda e de psicologia aplicada que tentam ensinar às mulheres como superar o trauma de um rompimento amoroso e voltar a apaixonar-se, Penélope parte de um único pressuposto: que a leitora não quer deixar tudo para trás, nem tãopouco quer esquecer o seu amor.

Paulina Chiziane,"Delfina é uma mulher bonita, «uma negra daquelas que os brancos gostam». A história de vida desta Delfina, «dos contrates, dos conflitos, das confusões e contradições», é a história da mulher africana, a história da apocalíptica perda do sonho. Esta mulher debate-se entre «escolher o caminho do sofrimento», o amor que sente por José dos Montes, e «eliminar a sua raça para ganhar a liberdade», procurando o homem branco que lhe dará o alimento e o conforto que deseja. Mas o que é o amor para a mulher negra? Na terra onde as mulheres se casam por encomenda na adolescência? O problema arrasta-se ao longo do livro, aparentemente sem solução: «viver em dois mundos é o mesmo que viver em dois corpos, não se pode. Tu és negra, jamais serás branca». Mesmo assim a mulher negra «procura um filho mulato, para aliviar o negro da sua pele como quem alivia as roupas de luto». O sufoco das palavras outrora silenciadas, a valentia e a frontalidade gritam alto nos romances de Paulina Chiziane. Neste diálogo consigo própria, a conhecida escritora moçambicana, mistura imaginação, fantástico, misticismo, num retrato poderoso e peculiar da sociedade e da mulher africanas.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Paulina Chiziane\O Alegre Canto da Perdiz (1855)\cover.jpg,9789722121873,2017-10-27T13:14:19+01:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Romance, General, Autores Portugueses",O Alegre Canto da Perdiz,1855

Paul Theroux & Paulo Afonso,"A Costa do Mosquito é o romance mais conhecido, e um dos mais vibrantes, de Paul Theroux. Um livro ""arrebatador"", segundo o escritor Anthony Burgess. Para o jornal The Washington Post, trata-se de uma ""visão impressionante e perturbadora da psique americana"". O autor constrói um texto ágil, cheio de surpresas, para narrar a saga de Allie Fox, um homem inconformado com a vida de consumo e sedentarismo dos Estados Unidos. É um controverso inventor de aparelhos estranhos, pouco práticos, e sustenta a família com trabalhos esporádicos para um fazendeiro local. Com sonhos de criar uma sociedade perfeita, fundada nos princípios da tecnologia e do domínio da natureza, ele abandona os EUA com a mulher, seus dois meninos e as pequenas filhas gêmeas, em busca de uma nova vida em meio à selva em Honduras. Através dos olhos de Charlie, seu filho mais velho, acompanhamos a jornada. Determinado a construir uma civilização melhor do que a que deixou para trás, embrenha-se na mata, constrói casas, cultiva sementes trazidas dos Estados Unidos e se dedica a suas invencionices. Combate missionários e procura trazer melhorias aos índios. Quer redescobrir uma forma mais pura de vida, em que o homem seja capaz de controlar a natureza e fundamentar sua vida baseada na razão. Seu experimento utópico, no entanto, pode ruir a qualquer momento, e sua crescente loucura é uma ameaça à família que julgava proteger. Adaptado para o cinema nos anos 1980, A Costa do Mosquito é o livro mais ambicioso e contundente de Paul Theroux, e um dos grandes romances americanos das últimas décadas.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Paul Theroux\A costa de mosquito (1859)\cover.jpg,9788560281909,1981-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,Alfaguara Brasil,4,,1.0,"Travel, Classics, Adventure, Aventura, Romance",A costa de mosquito,1859
Paul Bowles,"O Céu que nos Protege é o grande romance de Paul Bowles. Foi escrito em grande parte no deserto, onde a ação se desenrola. Publicado em 1954, nele, como em toda a ficção de Bowles, reflete-se sobre o absurdo do mundo moderno, onde a crueza, a corrupção e a irrupção do desejo surge a par da inocência de quem não compreende nem julga. Kit e Port são um casal que percorre o Sahara: à medida que se adentram no deserto, arriscam-se continuamente e atraiçoam-se até a um ponto de não retorno, até à loucura ou à morte. 
Aqui, como em outras obras de Bowles, não há culpados; há uma hierarquia de valores, uma explicação do humano. Os escritos de Bowles têm operado uma enorme sedução sobre várias décadas de leitores. Gore Vidal considerou-o um dos expoentes da ficção americana.

De que futuros abdicamos pelo simples facto de termos apenas uma vida para viver?No dia 3 de março de 1947, na maternidade do hospital Beth Israel em Newark, New Jersey, nasce Archibald Isaac Ferguson, filho único de Rose e Stanley Ferguson. Uma só criança a quem são dados quatro caminhos ficcionais diferentes, quatro direções possíveis. Uma pessoa que se desdobra em quatro, para assim viver quatro vidas paralelas e absolutamente diferentes, mercê das circunstâncias, do acaso, e das escolhas. Os contrastes entre os quatro Fergusons são evidentes. As distintas relações com a família e as amizades, o amor romântico e as paixões intelectuais percorrem a tumultuosa paisagem da América, entretecendo-se com momentos cruciais da História do século xx. Em comum, o fascínio por uma mulher: a magnífica Amy Schneiderman. Todavia, cada uma das relações entre os quatro Fergusons e Amy é única.

Orhan Pamuk,"Muitas vezes comparado a autores como Proust, Kafka, Eco, Borges ou Marquéz, Orhan Pamuk é o romancista turco mais galardoado a nível nacional e internacional, tendo sido recentemente distinguido com o IMPAC, o mais valioso prémio literário do mundo. Profundamente inovador no contexto do romance turco, Pamuk faz a ponte entre o Ocidente e o Oriente, a modernidade e a tradição, o passado e o futuro. Nada é ao acaso. Ao fluxo de histórias aparentemente desligadas, de pensamentos metafísicos, sonhos, fábulas, memórias, sátiras sociais e excursões históricas subjaz um único intuito: a busca de identidade - de si mesmo, de alguém que se ama, da própria Turquia, da cidade de Istambul, de um significado para a vida. Quando Galip, o protagonista, inicia uma procura desesperada por Ruya e Djélâl, a mulher e o primo direito subitamente desaparecidos, fá-lo, efectivamente, a vários níveis, e as suas tentativas para encontrá-los representam a própria tentativa de Pamuk para descrever a busca.  
Os Jardins da Memória é uma obra apaixonante, provocadora e inventiva, uma tapeçaria esplêndida da cultura do Médio Oriente e islâmica, e também uma fascinante meditação sobre a identidade, a memória e a realidade.

Olivier Ikor,"As caravelas... eram apenas cascas de noz. No entanto, enquanto o resto da Europa se dilacerava entre a Guerra dos Cem Anos e as guerras religiosas, foi a bordo delas que, durante um século e meio, os marinheiros portugueses, tão audaciosos quanto obstinados, navegaram ao longo do litoral africano, dobraram o Cabo da Boa Esperança, atracaram nas costas brasileiras, impuseram-se em Calecute, no grande mercado mundial das especiarias. Poderiam ter parado por ali e regressado a casa com fortuna feita... Mas não! As caravelas prosseguiram o seu caminho em direcção ao Japão, à China e a Macau. Contudo, a grande epopeia das caravelas desapareceu um dia nas chamas das fogueiras da Inquisição. Os portugueses conservam ainda a alegre e orgulhosa saudade de terem sido os descobridores e os mestres dos oceanos, porque apesar de todas as tormentas que a História os fez atravessar, Portugal nunca foi um «país pequeno».

Stan Bertolli, agente da CIA sediado no Cairo, já teve a sua dose de chamadas a meio da noite. Mas fica de coração apertado ao ouvir a voz da única mulher que amou, e que lhe telefona para saber por que razão o marido foi assassinado.  
Omar Halawi trabalhou durante muitos anos nos serviços secretos egípcios e está perfeitamente dentro do jogo.

Nuno Nepomuceno,"Nas comunidades judaicas de Londres e Lisboa, ocorre uma série de homicídios, todos eles recriando episódios bíblicos. Atos bárbaros de antissemitismo ou de pura vingança? 
Um rabino é encontrado morto numa das mais famosas sinagogas de Londres. O corpo, disposto como num quadro renascentista, representa o sacrifício do filho de Abraão, patriarca do povo judeu. 
O caso parece encerrado quando um jovem professor universitário a lecionar numa das faculdades da cidade é acusado do homicídio. Descendente de portugueses, existem provas irrefutáveis contra si e nada poderá salvá-lo da vida na prisão. 
Mas é então que ocorrem outros crimes, recriando episódios bíblicos em circunstâncias cada vez mais macabras. E as dúvidas instalam-se. 
Estarão ou não estes acontecimentos relacionados? 
Poderá o docente vir a ser injustamente condenado? 
Porque insistirá a sua família em pedir ajuda a um antigo professor, ele próprio ainda em conflito com os seus próprios pecados? 
As autoridades contratam uma jovem profiler criminal para as ajudar a descobrir a verdade. Mas conseguirá esta mente brilhante ultrapassar o facto de também ela ter sido uma vítima no passado? 
Abordando temas fraturantes da sociedade contemporânea como o antissemitismo e o conflito israelo-árabe, e inspirando-se nos Dez Mandamentos e noutros episódios marcantes do Antigo Testamento, Pecados Santos guia-nos através das ruas históricas de Londres, Lisboa e Jerusalém, numa viagem intimista e chocante sobre o que de mais negro e vil tem a condição humana.

É ali que ele irá morrer, naquele pedaço de chão árido, de onde se avista Jerusalém. Faltam-lhe as forças, pesam-lhe os anos, os remorsos, a dúvida. E a raiva também, pois, apesar de ter cumprido os preceitos da Lei, foi-lhe negada a paz de espírito. Assim entendeu o Criador, que tomou como Sua a mulher que lhe estava prometida, e nela plantou a semente de um filho bastardo - Jesus. José não compreende esse Deus, que põe e dispõe dos homens, esse Criador que não respeita a obra criada, que nega o livre arbítrio, que envia o filho à terra e o deixa morrer na cruz, como um ladrão.

Nuno Gomes Garcia,"ROMANCE FINALISTA DO PRÉMIO LEYA 
No dia 26 de março de 1487, o Sol apaga-se subitamente no reino de Portugal. Sem explicação para tão súbitas trevas – que uns atribuem à maldade castelhana e outros à heresia dos judeus –, D. João II envia dois espiões em demanda da solução que restitua a luz ao País e evite o seu definhamento. Com Pêro da Covilhã e Afonso de Paiva irá também, guardado num estojo, um par de olhos de diamante que outrora pertenceram a um menino chamado Mil-Sóis, cujo olhar cegava quem o encarasse, e que são a peça fundamental desta missão. 
Enquanto Pêro da Covilhã narra o seu périplo de Lisboa à Etiópia, das Índias ao reino do Monomotapa, de Meca a Sofala, quase sempre disfarçado de mouro e constantemente perdido em bordéis, Salvador – um embalsamador albino com um estranho passado – ficará de guarda à mulher do espião, por quem nutre há muito um amor secreto, e não cessará de procurar os olhos que possam devolver a luz ao seu irmão Mil-Sóis. 
O Dia em que o Sol Se Apagou, finalista do Prémio LeYa em 2014, é uma obra fascinante que inventa um cataclismo improvável para reescrever o período áureo da História de Portugal.

Nuno Camarneiro,"Num prédio encostado à praia, homens, mulheres e crianças - vizinhos que se cruzam mas se desconhecem - andam à procura do que lhes falta: um pouco de paz, de música, de calor, de um deus que lhes sirva. Todas as janelas estão viradas para dentro e até o vento parece soprar em quem lá vive. Há uma viúva sozinha com um gato, um homem que se esconde a inventar futuros, o bebê que testa os pais desavindos, o reformado que constrói loucuras na cave, uma família quase quase normal, um padre com uma doença de fé, o apartamento vazio cheio dos que o deixaram. O elevador sobe cansado, a menina chora e os canos estrebucham. É esse o som dos dias, porque não há maneira de o medo se fazer ouvir. A semana em que decorre esta história é bruscamente interrompida por uma tempestade que deixa o prédio sem luz e suspende as vidas das personagens - como uma bolha no tempo que permite pensar, rever o passado, perdoar, reagir, ser também mais vizinho. Entre o fim de um ano e o começo de outro, tudo pode realmente acontecer - e, pelo meio, nasce Cristo e salva-se um homem. Embora numa cidade de província, e à beira-mar, este prédio fica mesmo ao virar da esquina, talvez o habitemos e não o saibamos.

A princípio não se aproxima muito dela, mas o trabalho em conjunto obriga-o a reconhecer que se sente fascinado pela sua beleza... e surpreendido pela sua boa disposição contagiante. Tão contagiante que, pela primeira vez desde a morte do irmão, Jordan sente-se vivo. Mas infelizmente nem todos vêem com bons olhos a aproximação de Kasey e Jordan... e há quem esteja disposta a tudo para os separar.

Mas, sobretudo, tem um olhar maduro, límpido e frio, avaliando o mundo que a rodeia com profundidade e precisão.O seu diário – que começou a escrever aos 13 anos – representa uma das descobertas mais importantes dos últimos tempos e um tocante testemunho directo do terror estalinista, entre 1932 e 1937.Nesta obra, ficamos a saber, pela voz de Nina, como se vivia nos anos trinta em Moscovo, onde as buscas estavam na ordem do dia, o espectro da prisão e até mesmo do gulag, era uma perspectiva real e onde a fome constituía uma presença constante.

Nikolai Vasilevich Gogol & Sergio Kon & Tatiana Belinky,"Almas Mortas e O Inspetor Geral, de Gógol, constituíram dois marcos extraordinários na história da literatura russa. Ali, até o início do século XIX, as obras formadoras e dominantes da língua haviam sido as do poema e da épica, sobretudo as de Lomonossov e as de Púschkin. Com Gógol, a prosa adquiriu o status de arte e a realidade do país revelou-se, com o espanto de muitos, para além de sua aparente leveza de burla, um retrato amargo, impiedoso e grotesco da sociedade. Por isso mesmo, a idéia central do romance, sugerida por Púschkin após a leitura de uma nota jornalística, permitiu a Gógol pintar brilhantemente uma enorme variedade de personagens, cuja força reside em seu poder de caracterização do universal pelo específico, o que levou Púschkin a dizer, apesar de toda comicidade ali destilada: 'eu não ri, chorei, Deus, como é triste a nossa Rússia'. Assim, a denominação 'almas mortas' constitui não apenas a metáfora de um golpe ou de uma prática ardilosa no regime czarista, mas ainda uma expressão de até onde pode ir o decaimento do espírito humano, a contradição em que ele pode entrar com todo o padrão ético e fundamento religioso da existência. Este duplo retrato é o que certamente torna perene a obra, o riso 'gogoliano' que, até hoje, chega ao leitor, não só em sua textualidade autoral, como no rastro que deixou na literatura de Turguêniev, Dostoiévski, Bábel, na poesia e no teatro, o que representa, sem dúvida, o signo maior da visão e da força de linguagem deste escritor russo-ucraniano.

Niklas Nat Och Dag,"Prémio Livro do Ano (Suécia) Prémio da Academia Sueca de Escritores de Crime (Suécia) Prémio para melhor romance Storytel Awards (Suécia) Prémio Crimetime Specsavers (Suécia) Finalista do CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger (Reino Unido) Finalista do Golden Bullet Award (Noruega) Finalista LiveLib Reader's choice Awards (Rússia)  No seu romance de estreia, 1793, Niklas Natt och Dag pinta um retrato convincente do final do século XVIII em Estocolmo. Através dos olhos dos diferentes narradores, o verniz em pó e a pintura da época são retirados para revelar a realidade assustadora, mas fascinante, escondida além dos factos secos dos textos de História. Com um pé firmemente cravado na tradição literária e outro na literatura de suspense, Natt och Dag cria um género inteiramente novo de thriller histórico sugestivo e realista. 1793, Estocolmo. Quatro anos após da tomada da Bastilha e mais de um ano depois da morte de Gustavo III da Suécia, as guerras estrangeiras esvaziaram os tesouros e a nação é governada com mão de ferro pelo senhor do reino. Na esteira do falecimento do velho rei, a confiança transformou-se num bem escasso. A paranóia e as conspirações sussurradas abundam em todos os cantos. Uma promessa de violência estala no ar enquanto os cidadãos comuns se sentem cada vez mais vulneráveis aos caprichos dos que estão no poder. Quando Mickel Cardell, um ex-soldado aleijado e ex-guarda noturno, encontra um corpo mutilado flutuando no lago malcheiroso da cidade, sente-se compelido a dar ao homem não identificado um enterro condigno. Para Cecil Winge, um brilhante advogado que é também detetive consultor na Polícia de Estocolmo, um corpo sem braços, pernas ou olhos é um enigma formidável e uma última oportunidade de acertar as coisas antes de perder a sua batalha com a morte. Juntos, Winge e Cardell vasculham Estocolmo para descobrir a identidade do corpo, encontrando o lado sórdido da elite da cidade. 1793 retrata a capacidade de se ser cruel em nome da sobrevivência ou da ganância - mas também a capacidade para o amor, a amizade e o desejo de um mundo melhor. Os elogios da crítica:«Complexo e rico. Além dos personagens fascinantes, a maior força de Natt och Dag pode estar na selecção dos pormenores que usa para descrever uma cidade com dois séculos de história. Este é o primeiro romance publicado de Natt och Dag, mas parece demasiado habilidoso e seguro para ser a sua primeira obra.»New York Journal of Books «Um mistério histórico soberbamente pormenorizado.»Irish Times  «O noir sueco não pode ficar mais obscuro.»The Herald «Niklas Natt och Dag pega na tradição do crime escandinavo contemporâneo e dá-lhe uma reviravolta histórica assustadoramente horrível# Natt não nos poupa a nada, detalhando horror após horror na sua prosa firme e robusta.»The Guardian  «Um romance de estreia notável. A mais recente sensação escandinava.»Sunday Times «Este thriller histórico emocionante anuncia, certamente, a chegada de um novo e delicado talento europeu. Vívido e absorvente.»The Observer «Uma leitura emocionante e chocante.»The Times «No seu romance de estreia, Natt och Dag examina os efeitos de um assassinato brutal sobre aqueles que o investigam - e explora as causas psicológicas do crime... Arrepiante e instigante. Implacável, bem escrito, impossível de largar.»Kirkus «[Um] primeiro romance magistral... Natt och Dag usa a estrutura do livro, que inclui flashbacks e várias perspectivas, para aumentar o suspense e aprofundar a caracterização. A Academia Sueca de Escritores Criminais nomeou este romance de estreia como uma das apostas de 2017, e os leitores ficarão igualmente impressionados.»Publishers Weekly  «Imperdível para os leitores que apreciam enredos obscuros. A caracterização é excelente, assim como a evocação da Estocolmo setecentista, um cenário histórico pouco comum que fornece um pano de fundo vibrante para um mistério também fora do habitual. Os enredos secundários de Natt och Dag encaixam perfeitamente, o seu ritmo é habilidoso e ele explora com aprumo o tema principal do seu romance: Homo homini lupus est - O homem é lobo para o homem.»Booklist «Lembra um outro thriller de estreia auspicioso, cuja acção decorre num lugar e num tempo desconhecidos: O nome da rosa, de Umberto Eco. Faz quase quarenta anos que esse thriller histórico captou a imaginação do mundo, absorvendo leitores e impulsionando o seu autor ao estrelato internacional. O mundo está preparado para outra estrela, e Natt och Dag é certamente um digno candidato.»Bookpage «É cedo para escolher os melhores livros do ano, mas 1793, a estonteante estreia de Niklas Natt och Dag, será, com certeza, um deles.» The Washington Post «Lê-se como uma temporada de True Detective... Ancorado num poderoso sentido do lugar e num memorável elenco de personagens... Não o vai esquecer tão cedo.» USA Today «Um mistério provocador, uma atmosfera claustrofóbica e um par de investigadores inesquecíveis.» Newsday «Um romance sombrio, vibrante e feroz, quase físico. Uma estreia impressionante. Um autor a seguir.» Le Parisien «Maravilhosamente escrito. As descrições detalhadas de locais e personagens e a sua história bem trabalhada garantem que 1793 leve o leitor numa jornada que não termina até se ler a cena final.» De Standaard «Um thriller histórico rico e atmosférico, com personagens brilhantemente desenhados.» Buchkultur «Uma trama bem estruturada, contada com uma elegância brutal e dura.» Politiken «Estocolmo em 1793 é o pano de fundo para um thriller histórico incrivelmente interessante, atmosférico e bem escrito.»Litteratursiden «Uma obra-prima inesperada, uma mistura selvagem e inusitada de géneros, que, de uma só vez, consegue renovar toda a ficção policial.»Arne Dahl «Forte, sangrento, intrincado e cativante. O melhor thriller histórico que li em vinte anos.»A. J. Finn «Uma história emocionante, enervante, inteligente e bonita. Lê-la é como oferecer um pequeno presente a si mesmo.»Fredrik Backman «Um thriller histórico sem paralelo e de grande qualidade literária. É cru, elegante, comovente e extremamente cativante até a última página. 1793 merece um lugar entre os clássicos do género.»Erik Axl Sund",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Niklas Nat Och Dag\1793_ O Lobo e o Vigia (1897)\cover.jpg,9789896658793,2019-07-02T13:12:45+01:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Thriller, Historical, General, Autores Estrangeiros, Mystery, Mystery & Detective",1793: O Lobo e o Vigia,1897

Nigel Cliff,"Guerra Santa é uma história épica de espiões, intrigas e traições. E é também uma interpretação nova e radical das viagens pioneiras de Vasco da Gama, encaradas como o ponto de viragem na luta entre a cristandade e o islão. Em 1498, um jovem capitão navegou de Portugal, circum-navegou África, atravessou o oceano Índico e descobriu o caminho marítimo para a Índia e, com isso, o acesso à riqueza do Oriente. Foi a mais longa viagem conhecida da História. O presente livro revela uma inesperada verdade: a de que tanto Vasco da Gama como o seu rival Cristóvão Colombo se fizeram ao mar para iniciar uma Cruzada, com o objetivo de alcançar as Índias; controlar o mercado de especiarias, sedas e pedras preciosas; e reclamar para Portugal e Espanha, respetivamente, todos os territórios descobertos. Vasco da Gama triunfou na sua missão e criou uma linha divisória entre as eras históricas dos muçulmanos e dos cristãos - conhecidas, no Ocidente, como as eras medieval e moderna.

Nadia Murad,"Nadia Murad foi vítima da jihad sexual do Estado Islâmico. Escapou e contra-atacou: converteu-se em defensora dos Direitos Humanos - a primeira pessoa a ser nomeada Embaixadora da Boa Vontade para a Dignidade dos Sobreviventes de Tráfico de Seres Humanos das Nações Unidas - e foi ainda nomeada para o Prémio Nobel da Paz.  Esta é a sua história. A 15 de Agosto de 2014, a vida de Nadia Murad mudou para sempre. As tropas do Estado Islâmico invadiram a sua pequena aldeia, no Norte do Iraque, onde a minoria yazidi levava uma vida tranquila, e perpetraram um massacre. Executaram homens e mulheres, entre eles a mãe e seis dos irmãos de Nadia, e amontoaram os corpos em valas comuns. Nadia, então com 21 anos, foi sequestrada, tal como milhares de jovens e meninas, e vendida como escrava sexual. Os soldados torturaram-na e violaram-na repetidamente, meses a fio, até que, certa noite, como por milagre, conseguiu fugir pelas ruas de Mossul. Assim começou a sua longa e perigosa viagem até à liberdade. Em pequena, Nadia jamais imaginou que um dia falaria nas Nações Unidas ou que seria nomeada para o Prémio Nobel da Paz. Nunca estivera em Bagdad nem tão-pouco tinha visto um avião. Hoje, a história de Nadia instiga o mundo a prestar atenção ao genocídio do seu povo. É um apelo à acção para deter os crimes do Estado Islâmico, um poderoso testemunho da força de vontade humana. Eu serei a última é, também, uma carta de amor a um país desaparecido, a uma comunidade vulnerável e a uma família devastada pela guerra. O valor e o testemunho de uma jovem podem mudar o mundo. Para que ninguém esqueça porque quer ser a última a vivê-la, Nadia conta a sua história. Sobre Eu serei a última: «Uma narrativa crua e aterradora do genocídio religioso e da vida em cativeiro às mãos do Estado Islâmico feita por uma jovem sobrevivente yazidi. Com pormenores vívidos e emoção tão autêntica quanto dolorosa, a autora relata não só a sua inimaginável tragédia como a de todo um povo, o seu, que o resto do mundo ignora. Uma autobiografia simultaneamente devastadora e inspiradora, que tem um efeito determinante no leitor: o de um apelo urgente à acção.»Kirkus Reviews «Nadia Murad faz parte dessa longa e invisível história de mulheres fortes e indomáveis a quem nem sequer a violação, como táctica de guerra, conseguiu vergar, que se mantêm firmes e que estão dispostas a quebrar o odioso silêncio que lhes é imposto e a exigir justiça e liberdade para os seus semelhantes.»Times («As 100 pessoas mais influentes de 2016») «Nadia é mais que uma sobrevivente [...] é uma mulher valente, determinada, obstinada e apaixonada, que decidiu contar os piores horrores por que passou, para que outros não tenham de passar pelo mesmo.»Samantha Power, embaixadora dos Estados Unidos nas Nações Unidas «Nadia é um ser humano extraordinário, com um coração e uma alma maravilhosos.

O advogado Jerry Petersson, o novo e rico proprietário, conhecido pelo seu espírito impulsivo e irascível, nunca mais resolverá novos casos. Chamada a investigar o crime, Malin Fors suspeita dos Fågelsjö, uma família aristocrática que, por problemas financeiros, foi forçada a vender a Jerry Petersson a propriedade há séculos na família. Mas seria isso motivo suficiente para um homicídio? Ou será que por detrás dos muitos milhões, das obras de arte valiosas, dos fatos caros, e do sucesso nos negócios, Jerry Petersson não era quem parecia? Acompanhando Malin, do outro lado de uma tela finíssima, a sombra da vítima vai desfiando a memória do seu passado e dos acontecimentos que conduziram à sua morte.

O presente romance, publicado na China em 1995, causou grande controvérsia. Algum conteúdo de teor sexual e o facto de não retratar uma versão da luta de classes consentânea com os cânones do Partido Comunista Chinês, obrigaram Mo Yan a escrever uma autocrítica ao seu próprio livro, e, mais tarde, a retirá-lo de circulação. Ainda assim, inúmeros exemplares continuam a circular clandestinamente.Num país onde os homens dominam, este é um romance épico sobre as mulheres. Sugerido no próprio título, o corpo feminino serve como imagem e metáfora ao livro. A protagonista nasce em 1900 e casa-se com 17 anos. Mãe de 9 filhos, apenas o mais novo, é rapaz. Jintong é inseguro e fraco, contrastando com as 8 irmãs, fortes e corajosas. Cada um dos 6 capítulos representa um período, desde o fim da dinastia Qing, passando pela invasão japonesa, à guerra civil, à revolução cultural e aos anos pós Mao.Um romance que percorre e retrata a China do último século através da vida de uma família em que os seres verdadeiramente fortes e corajosos são as mulheres. 
«Se quiserem, podem ignorar todos os meus outros livros, mas é obrigatório que leiam Peito Grande, Ancas Largas. É um romance sobre a história, a guerra, a fome, a política, a religião, o amor e o sexo!» Mo Yan.

Miguel Torga,"PREFÁCIO DO AUTOR À TRADUÇÃO FRANCESA 
Querido Leitor: 
Vais ler de uma assentada, se a macicez do texto te não desanimar a curiosidade, os seis dias desta Criação do Mundo, que foram aparecendo nas montras separadamente, à medida que iam decorrendo. Livro temerariamente concebido na mocidade, imprevisível na trama e no rumo, só o tempo lhe podia dar corpo e remate, traçando-lhe o enredo e marcando-lhe a duração. O que acabou por acontecer, já que os fados, condoídos da cegueira do projecto, não quiseram calar, antes de ele ser levado a cabo, a voz do autor. 
Todos nós criamos o mundo à nossa medida. O mundo longo dos longevos e curto dos que partem prematuramente. O mundo simples dos simples e o complexo dos complicados. Criamo-lo na consciência, dando a cada acidente, facto ou comportamento a significação intelectual ou afectiva que a nossa mente ou a nossa sensibilidade consentem. E o certo é que há tantos mundos como criaturas. Luminosos uns, brumosos outros, e todos singulares. O meu tinha de ser como é, uma torrente de emoções, volições, paixões e intelecções a correr desde a infância à velhice no chão duro de uma realidade proteica, convulsionada por guerras, catástrofes, tiranias e abominações, e também rica de mil potencialidades, que ficará na História como paradigma do mais infausto e nefasto que a humanidade conheceu, a par do mais promissor. Mundo de contrastes, lírico e atormentado, de ascensões e quedas, onde a esperança, apesar de sucessivamente desiludida, deu sempre um ar da sua graça, e que não trocaria por nenhum outro, se tivesse de escolher. Plasmado finalmente em prosa — crónica, romance, memorial, testamento —, tu dirás, depois da última página voltada, se valeu a pena ser visitado. Por mim, fiz o que pude. Homem de palavras, testemunhei com elas a imagem demorada de uma tenaz, paciente e dolorosa construção reflexiva frita com o material candente da própria vida.

Miguel Sousa Tavares,"Verlagsinfo: Sevilha, 1915 - Vale do Paraíba, 1945: trinta anos da história do século XX correm ao longo das páginas deste romance, com cenário no Alentejo, Espanha e Brasil. Através da saga dos Ribera Flores, proprietários rurais alentejanos, somos transportados para os anos tumultuosos da primeira metade de um século marcado por ditaduras e confrontos sangrentos, onde o caminho que conduz à liberdade parece demasiado estreito e o preço a pagar demasiado alto. Entre o amor comum à terra que os viu nascer e o apelo pelo novo e desconhecido, entre os amores e desamores de uma vida e o confronto de ideias que os separam, dois irmãos seguem percursos diferentes, cada um deles buscando à sua maneira o lugar da coerência e da felicidade. Rio das Flores resulta de um minucioso e exaustivo trabalho de pesquisa histórica, que serve de pano de fundo a um enredo de amores, paixões, apego à terra e às suas tradições e, simultaneamente, à vontade de mudar a ordem estabelecida das coisas. Três gerações sucedem-se na mesma casa de família, tentando manter imutável o que a terra uniu, no meio da turbulência causada por décadas de paixões e ódios como o mundo nunca havia visto.

Miguel Sousa Tavares,"Em 'Não te deixarei morrer', David Crockett, escrito anteriormente ao lançamento de seu grande romance, Equador, Miguel Sousa Tavares faz uma seleção de 38 textos publicados em revistas portuguesas, além de material inédito, para criar um agradável livro de contos, no qual os leitores podem se deliciar com a prosa de um dos mais respeitados jornalistas de Portugal, que obteve grande sucesso no campo da ficção. O título do livro é uma homenagem ao herói de infância do autor - o aventureiro David Crockett, um dos pioneiros do Oeste americano, imortalizado no cinema e nos quadrinhos. É também uma alusão à pureza inicial e à insistência obstinada na conquista da felicidade.","C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Miguel Sousa Tavares\Nao te deixarei morrer, David Crock (1952)\cover.jpg",9788520917527,2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,NOVA FRONTEIRA,3,,1.0,Romance,"Não te deixarei morrer, David Crockett",1952
Miguel Sousa Tavares,"**Há viagens sem regresso nem repetição.**  
«Éramos donos do que víamos: até onde o olhar alcançava, era tudo nosso. E tínhamos um deserto inteiro para olhar.»  
«Ali estavas tu, então, tão nova que parecias irreal, tão feliz que era quase impossível de imaginar. Ali estavas tu, exactamente como te tinha conhecido. E o que era extraordinário é que, olhando-te, dei-me conta de que não tinhas mudado nada, nestes vinte anos: como nunca mais te vi, ficaste assim para sempre, com aquela idade, com aquela felicidade, suspensa, eterna, desde o instante em que te apontei a minha *Nikon* e tu ficaste exposta, sem defesa, sem segredos, sem dissimulação alguma.»  
«Parecia-me que já tínhamos vivido um bocado de vida imenso e tão forte que era só nosso e nós mesmos não falávamos disso, mas sentíamo-lo em silêncio: era como se o segredo que guardávamos fosse a própria partilha dessa sensação. E que qualquer frase, qualquer palavra, se arriscaria a quebrar esse sortilégio.»  
«Eu sei que ela se lembra, sei que foi feliz então, como eu fui. Mas deve achar que eu me esqueci, que me fechei no meu silêncio, que me zanguei com o seu último desaparecimento, que vivo amuado com ela, desde então. Não é verdade, Cláudia. Vê como eu me lembro, vê se não foram assim, passo por passo, aqueles quatro dias que demorámos até chegar juntos ao deserto.»

Nesta viagem fora do seu quarto, o autor transporta-nos ao seu mundo mediterrâneo, ao sul de Portugal, à Croácia, a Roma, à Sicília, ao Brasil e aos lugares da História por onde passaram figuras gigantes. No regresso a casa, explica a razão da sua escrita.

Miguel Sousa Tavares,"Ismael é um coelho bravo que vive no bosque. Dos seus 51 irmãos, foi ele o escolhido pelo pai, o respeitado Coelho Maltese, para ficar junto de si e aprender tudo o que ele tinha para ensinar: todos os segredos do bosque, todos os segredos do mundo. A Ismael, o pai aconselha-o, entre outras coisas, a ter cuidado com os homens, esses bichos inteligentes que escrevem a língua que falam. Mal sabe Coelho Maltese que a abertura ao mundo o levará a conhecer a música e, sobretudo, a figura memorável de um jovem músico chamado Chopin. 
Já doente, Chopin refugiou-se numa casa meio abandonada, e passa os dias a tossir; quando chega a noite, senta-se ao piano e toca. Aos poucos, atraído pela música grandiosa, Ismael perde a timidez inicial e, cheio de cautelas, vai-se aventurando. Ao ser descoberto, e directamente interpelado pelo genial pianista, o coelhinho bravo descai-se e revela o seu dom, apesar de ter prometido ao pai que nunca o faria. Sim, porque Ismael tem um dom: consegue entender a língua humana e, mais, fazer-se entender através da nossa linguagem de homens. 
O que poderá resultar de tão singular e tocante relacionamento?

Miguel Sousa Tavares,"Numa madrugada de 1988, três estudantes de Évora e uma jovem de dezesseis anos saem para uma farra regada a muito álcool que terminaria em tragédia. Um dos rapazes é Filipe, último descendente da aldeia alentejana de Medronhais da Serra, hoje habitada por um único homem, seu avô, Tomaz da Burra. O romance do português Miguel Sousa Tavares acompanha as vidas desta família desde a Revolução dos Cravos, que derrubou a ditadura de Salazar em abril de 1974, até os dias atuais. O pai de Filipe, Francisco, ficou viúvo muito cedo e sempre pareceu alheio ao que acontecia na aldeia. Mas, com as mudanças políticas, ele parece encontrar na reforma agrária uma razão para viver e decide se mudar para uma fazenda comunal, deixando o filho único para ser cuidado pelos avós. Filipe cresce nesta Medronhais da Serra fora do tempo, um lugar que tinha pouco mais de cinquenta habitantes e demorou muito a ganhar o seu primeiro aparelho de televisão. Ele se torna arquiteto e vai trabalhar em uma cidade costeira do Alentejo, onde passa a conhecer cada vez mais de perto as sujeiras da corrupção política. Ao tentar não se envolver num esquema de fraudes e propinas, voltará a ser assombrado pela trágica noite que viveu na juventude. Narrado em um ritmo vertiginoso, que faz o leitor agarrar-se ao livro até o fim, Madrugada suja alterna a voz de diferentes personagens a cada capítulo. Além de um retrato crítico e acurado sobre as mudanças em Portugal nos últimos quarenta anos, o escritor criou uma história fascinante sobre como os acasos da vida nos levam a situações-limite.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Miguel Sousa Tavares\Madrugada suja (1956)\cover.jpg,9788580868159,2013-09-27T14:06:22+01:00,Companhia das Letras,3,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction, Romance",Madrugada suja,1956

Miguel Real,"Uma Nova Europa, aparentemente perfeita.Uma inesperada ameaça, a invasão da Grande Ásia.Que futuro para o nosso futuro ? Uma utopia?Em 2284, a Europa é maioritariamente composta por Baldios governados por clãs guerreiros que escravizam as populações esfomeadas; subsiste, porém, um território isolado por um cordão de segurança com uma sociedade que, por via da ciência e da tecnologia, atingiu um nível altíssimo de felicidade individual, pois todos os desejos podem ser consumados, ainda que apenas mentalmente. Nesta Nova Europa, as relações sexuais são livres e não se destinam à procriação: as crianças, desconhecendo os pais, nascem nos Criatórios em placentas sintéticas e seguem para Colégios onde, sem a ajuda de livros, andróides especializados incrementam as suas competências como futuros Cidadãos Dourados. As famílias reúnem-se por afinidades, ninguém trabalha e nem sequer existem nomes, para que ninguém se distinga, já que todas as conquistas se fazem em nome da comunidade. Mas este mundo aparentemente perfeito sofre uma inesperada ameaça: a Grande Ásia, lutando com graves problemas de demografia, acaba de invadir a Europa... Um velho Reitor, estudioso do passado, é chamado a liderar uma equipa que possa refundar algures a Nova Europa e a deixar testemunho da sua História.

Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra & Castilho E de Azevedo (viscondes De.),"Livro nº 66 da coleção História da Literatura  
Don Quixote is an early novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic manuscript he found in Toledo's bedraggled old Jewish quarter. 
The protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of adventures. His ""lady"" is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the illusion-struck ""knight"" (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never actually appears in the novel). 
Published in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.

Ou mudar de emprego. Ou ter paz interior. Agora a pergunta que vale milhões é esta: se sabemos o que queremos, porque é que não o fazemos? A resposta está no inconsciente. É lá que se escondem as “forças de bloqueio” que nos impedem de progredir. É como se o inconsciente fosse uma discoteca e a nossa própria mente fosse o porteiro difícil. E é justamente aí que a auto-hipnose entra em acção. Numa sessão de 15 minutos podemos criar as condições de relaxamento que nos permitem aceder ao inconsciente. Vamos lá dar uma voltinha, e quando “acordamos” somos outra pessoa – livre de conflitos interiores, relaxada, em paz. Miguel Cocco mostra-nos neste livro como o processo é simples. Primeiro explica-nos a ciência, ou seja, o funcionamento do cérebro. Depois ensina-nos, passo a passo, as melhores maneiras de darmos a volta ao porteiro da discoteca. Por outras palavras, mostra-nos como podemos hipnotizar-nos a nós próprios, onde e quando quisermos.Como veremos não são precisos pêndulos, nem palavras mágicas, nem sequer fechar os olhos. O que a auto-hipnose oferece são técnicas de relaxamento, de expansão de consciência, que nos conferem uma enorme leveza e bem-estar.

Michael Moorcock,"Karl Glogauer é um homem dos nossos tempos. Quando o destino lhe oferece a possibilidade de viajar no tempo, ele não tem dúvidas quanto ao lugar e à época que quer visitar: a Terra Santa no tempo de Jesus. Mas o que poderia ser uma viagem turística à morte do Messias e ao nascimento da maior religião do mundo revela-se uma desilusão: Maria é a libertina da aldeia, José um velho amargo e Jesus Cristo apenas um deficiente mental. Devotado ao ideal de um Jesus real e histórico, Karl acredita que tem de fazer alguma coisa. Reunindo seguidores, repetindo parábolas que consegue recordar e usando truques psicológicos para simular milagres, Karl toma o lugar do Messias. Mas fará sentido um Messias que, no final, não morra na cruz?

Mia Couto,"Primeiro romance de Mia Couto, Terra Sonâmbula é uma verdadeira aula sobre a velha arte de contar histórias. No Moçambique pós-independência, mergulhado em uma devastadora guerra civil, um velho e um menino empreendem uma viagem recheada de fantasias míticas. Um ônibus incendiado em uma estrada poeirenta serve de abrigo ao velho Tuahir e ao menino Muidinga, em fuga da guerra civil devastadora que grassa por toda parte em Moçambique. Como se sabe, depois de dez anos de guerra anticolonial (1965-75), o país do sudeste africano viu-se às voltas com um longo e sangrento conflito interno que se estendeu de 1976 a 1992. O veículo está cheio de corpos carbonizados. Mas há também um outro corpo à beira da estrada, junto a uma mala que abriga os ""cadernos de Kindzu"", o longo diário do morto em questão. A partir daí, duas histórias são narradas paralelamente: a viagem de Tuahir e Muidinga, e, em flashback, o percurso de Kindzu em busca dos naparamas, guerreiros tradicionais, abençoados pelos feiticeiros, que são, aos olhos do garoto, a única esperança contra os senhores da guerra. Terra Sonâmbula - considerado por júri especial da Feira do Livro de Zimbabwe um dos doze melhores livros africanos do século XX - é um romance em abismo, escrito numa prosa poética que remete a Guimarães Rosa.

São revelações de um universo dominado por uma espiritualidade que ele vai reaprendendo. À medida que se apercebe desse universo frágil e ameaçado, ele redescobre uma outra história para a sua própria vida e para a da sua terra. A pretexto do relato das extraordinárias peripécias que rodeiam o funeral, este novo romance de Mia Couto traduz, de uma forma a um tempo irónica e profundamente poética, a situação de conflito vivida por uma elite ambiciosa e culturalmente distanciada da maioria rural.

Acostumados a reconhecer nos povos africanos a violência e a miséria, o leitor encontrará nessa seleção uma delicadeza que não se vê nos relatos oficiais. As histórias selecionadas mostram a complexidade que move as relações familiares, a orfandade em um país que viveu por anos em guerra, a realidade das crianças submetidas ao trabalho infantil e os resquícios da luta pela independência. Mia Couto é um prosador bastante sensível às complexidades da vida e um escritor que constrói as narrativas inspiradas na linguagem oral, revelando a sua influência e admiração pelo nosso Guimarães Rosa, sem contar a presença do fantástico e do religioso em suas histórias.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Mia Couto\A menina sem palavra_ Historias de (2003)\cover.jpg,9788580868043,2013-09-11T14:08:47+01:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Short Stories (single author)",A menina sem palavra: Histórias de Mia Couto,2003
Mia Couto,"Depois da Independência de Portugal, em 1975, Moçambique enfrentou quase duas décadas de conflitos. O período foi marcado pela oposição entre os antigos guerrilheiros anticolonialistas da Frelimo (que tomaram o poder e tentaram implantar o socialismo no país) e o grupo de orientação conservadora Renamo (alinhado a Rodésia e África do Sul). A história de A varanda do frangipani se passa vinte anos após a Independência, depois dos acordos de paz de 1992. O romance é narrado pelo carpinteiro Ermelindo Mucanga, que morreu às vésperas da Independência, quando trabalhava nas obras de restauro da Fortaleza de S. Nicolau, onde funciona um asilo para velhos. Ele é um ""xipoco"", um fantasma que vive numa cova sob a árvore de frangipani na varanda da fortaleza colonial. As autoridades do país querem transformar Mucanga em herói nacional, mas ele pretende, ao contrário, morrer definitivamente. Para tanto, precisa ""remorrer"". Então, seguindo conselho de seu pangolim (uma espécie de tamanduá africano), encarna no inspetor de polícia Izidine Naíta, que está a caminho da Fortaleza para investigar a morte do diretor. Mais de vinte anos depois da independência de Moçambique, quando a guerra civil já arrefeceu, a Fortaleza é um lugar em que convergem heranças, memórias e contradições de um país novo e ao mesmo tempo profundamente ligado às tradições e aos mitos ancestrais. Da sua varanda se pode enxergar o horizonte. O romance de Mia Couto esboça, assim, uma saída utópica para um país em reconstrução.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Mia Couto\A varanda do frangipani (2004)\cover.jpg,9788535909845,2013-02-15T13:50:16+00:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,"Mystery, Autores Portugueses",A varanda do frangipani,2004
Mia Couto,"A Espada e a Azagaia é o segundo livro (o primeiro, Mulheres de Cinza, foi publicado em outubro de 2015) de uma trilogia — As Areias do Imperador — sobre os derradeiros dias do chamado Estado de Gaza, o segundo maior império em África dirigido por um africano. Ngungunyane (ou Gungunhane como ficou conhecido pelos portugueses) foi o último dos imperadores que governou toda a metade Sul do território de Moçambique. Derrotado em 1895 pelas forças portuguesas comandadas por Mouzinho de Albuquerque, o imperador Ngungunyane foi deportado para os Açores onde veio a morrer em 1906.A Espada e a Azagaia relata a guerra travada no Sul de Moçambique, no final do século XIX, entre Portugal e o Império de Gaza, e que teve como protagonistas Mouzinho de Albuquerque e Gungunhana.Este volume termina com a vitória das tropas portuguesas em Coolela e Chaimite e a prisão de Gungunhana.

Menna van Praag,"*Um livro que nos enche de esperança, coragem, inspiração e nos mostra como podemos ter tudo o que queremos e ser felizes*
May Fitzgerald tem, de repente, tudo o que sempre quis. Depois de anos a sentir-se gorda e pouco atraente e a procurar o amor nos sítios errados, tem finalmente a vida e o homem dos seus sonhos. Tudo devia ser tão perfeito – seguira a sua voz interior e ela conduzira-a à vida mágica com que sonhara.  
Mas quando a sua nova vida como escritora de sucesso tem início, os velhos demónios de May surgem para a atormentar. As antigas inseguranças reaparecem e ela deixa-se fascinar pela lisonja e pelo brilho da fama. O seu comportamento começa a afectar o namorado e ameaça destruir a relação de ambos. Conseguirá ela dar a volta à situação e provar que realmente é possível ter tudo? 
**Fama**  
É uma droga à qual muitos seres humanos imperfeitos não são imunes. É agradável com conta, peso e medida, mas é preciso cuidado para não querermos comparar-nos com aqueles materialmente mais bem sucedidos do que nós.  
**Amor**  
Uma vida com amor verdadeiro não é uma vida sem desafios e tumultos, e uma verdadeira alma gémea não deve completar-nos, mas sim desafiar-nos.  
**Dinheiro**  
É uma armadilha e sozinho não traz a felicidade e a realização pessoal. 
*Uma história sobre fazer escolhas e não perder o rumo, mas, sobretudo, uma história sobre a importância de seguir os sonhos!*

Melo de Matos,"De bom grado olhamos para o passado de Portugal. Com prazer rememoramos as épocas gloriosas da nossa história e até às vezes aquelas em que o oiro do Brasil alimentava as nossas vaidades sem alentar nem a nossa indústria, nem a nossa agricultura. Admiramos os heróis da história pátria, extasiamo-nos perante a largueza de vistas de Afonso de Albuquerque ou do Marquês de Pombal, mas não nos atrevemos a encarar de frente o que o futuro pode reservar para o nosso país. Se algum estadista nosso quis ter iniciativa, quis obrigar-nos a caminhar como as outras nações, ou passou por visionário ou foi taxado de aventureiro. Apontar nomes seria reforçar a nossa asserção, mas ainda se pode dizer que estão quentes as cinzas de alguns, não apagadas as paixões provocadas pelas ideias de outros e por isso mais vale seguir o conselho do Dante: ma guarda e passa e embarcarmo-nos no batel doirado da fantasia, para vivermos a Lisboa que deveríamos ter daqui por vinte anos, que é forçoso que tenhamos até antes dessa época, sob pena de darmos razão à profecia de um estadista inglês, cujo nome também não citaremos.

Nele, o protagonista, amigo de Tom Sawyer, vive inúmeras aventuras ao descer o rio Mississipi em uma jangada. A publicação de As venturas de Huckleberry Finn é marco na literatura norte-americana.

Mário de Sá-Carneiro,"""Loucura? — Mas afinal o que vem a ser a loucura?… Um enigma… Por isso mesmo é que às pessoas enigmáticas, incompreensíveis, se dá o nome de loucos…  
Que a loucura, no fundo, é como tantas outras, uma questão de maioria. A vida é uma convenção: isto é vermelho, aquilo é branco, unicamente porque se determinou chamar à cor disto vermelho e à cor daquilo branco. A maior parte dos homens adoptou um sistema determinado de convenções: é a gente de juízo…  
Pelo contrário, um número reduzido de indivíduos vê os objectos com outros olhos, chama-lhes outros nomes, pensa de maneira diferente, encara a vida de modo diverso. Como estão em minoria… são doidos…  
Se um dia porém a sorte favorecesse os loucos, se o seu número fosse superior e o género da sua loucura idêntico, eles é que passariam a ser os ajuizados: «Na terra dos cegos, quem tem um olho é rei», diz o adágio: na terra dos doidos, quem tem juízo, é doido, concluo eu.  
O meu amigo não pensava como toda a gente… Eu não o compreendia: chamava-lhe doido…  
Eis tudo.""

Mário de Sá-Carneiro,"Mário de Sá-Carneiro é um dos escritores mais conhecidos da literatura portuguesa. Foi um dos responsáveis, ao lado de Fernando Pessoa e Almada Negreiros, pelo movimento Modernista em Portugal. Mesmo tendo nos deixado muito novo, em apenas um curto período de tempo (de 1912 a 1916) conseguiu escrever uma obra significativa. Para Rafael Santana, que assina a apresentação deste livro, Sá-Carneiro ""foi aquele para quem vida e arte eram considerados termos indissociáveis, e não foi por acaso que ele próprio sinalizou ""a tristeza de nunca sermos dois"" ao final de ""Partida"", o primeiro do conjunto de 12 poemas que reuniu sob o título de Dispersão (1913)"". Mário de Sá-Carneiro, que não afirmava ser poeta, mas apenas um prosador, além deste livro teve outras incursões pela poesia. Indícios de oiro (1915) foi uma delas, e só veio a ser publicado postumamente, 21 anos depois. Sua publicação só foi possível porque, antes de morrer, Sá-Carneiro enviara os poemas para Fernando Pessoa ficar responsável pela edição. Neste livro, também, estão alguns dos poemas que publicou no primeiro número da revista Orpheu.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Mario de Sa-Carneiro\Dispersao & Indicios de oiro (2028)\cover.jpg,9788545557685,2019-02-15T12:38:50+00:00,Editora Moinhos (Camila Araujo da Silva MEI),4,,1.0,"Poetry, General, Autores Portugueses",Dispersão & Indícios de oiro,2028

Quase todas negligenciadas, quando não abandonadas e maltratadas, entregam-se à magia ou à leitura salvadoras. É assim com Beatriz, à beira do abismo no Faial, com Laura, abandonada pela mãe em «Eclipse», com Branca, perseguida pela madastra e o pai, com Maria do Resgate, que abre a porta aos anjos na falta da mãe, com Rute, ladra «sem culpa» de uma rosa apaixonante. Mas também com a infância de personagens históricas como a sanguinária condessa húngara Erzsébet, com a rebelde Carlota Joaquina, inconformada com um destino que não quis, a seduzir e enfeitiçar o pintor Maella autor do seu retrato oficial, ou literárias como Katie Lewis, apaixonada pela leitura e assim retratada por Edward Burne-Jones, a gerar o fascínio de Oscar Wilde.

Marian Izaguirre,"A Vida Quando era Nossa é um tributo à literatura, mas é sobretudo uma história de amizade entre duas mulheres. Uma história que começa quando se abre um livro e que só termina quando todas as pontas da narrativa se unem. 
«Tenho saudades do tempo em que a vida era nossa», diz Lola, a protagonista do romance. Sente falta da sua vida, tão cheia de esperança, feita de livros e conversas ao café, sestas ociosas e projetos de construir um país. A Espanha que, passo a passo, aprendia as regras da democracia.   
Mas, em 1936, chega um dia em que a vida se transforma em sobrevivência e agora, passados quinze anos, a única coisa que sobra é uma pequena livraria, meio escondida num dos bairros de Madrid, onde Lola e Matías, o marido, vendem romances e clássicos esquecidos.   
É nesse lugar modesto que, em 1951, Lola conhece Alice, uma mulher que encontrou nos livros uma razão para viver. Acompanhamos a amizade entre as duas, atrás do balcão a lerem o mesmo livro juntas, e isso leva-nos atrás no tempo, à Londres do início do século XX, para conhecermos uma menina que se perguntava quem seriam os seus pais…

Esta é a história da nobre família Távora, aqui contada na voz de Dona Mariana Bernarda e Dona Teresa Tomásia, duas senhoras desta ilustre Casa, que viveram em fausto e glória até o futuro marquês de Pombal tentar apagar a sua semente da face da Terra. 
Apesar de unidas pelo sangue e pela vaidade da sua estirpe, as duas fidalgas não podiam ser mais diferentes uma da outra. A primeira era uma mulher religiosa e recta; já a segunda - sua tia e cunhada - entregava-se sem pruridos a uma vida de luxúria, vivendo um romance pecaminoso com El-rei de Portugal. 
A altivez e o poder dos grandes Távoras muito incomodavam a Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Secretário de Estado. Tanto que, quando D. José I é vítima de um intrigante atentado, Sebastião José, futuro marquês de Pombal, tratou de os inculpar, prendendo-os em masmorras e conventos, sem poupar mulheres nem crianças. O Tribunal da Inconfidência, a que presidiu, torturou os réus e condenou-os a mortes cruéis. Por fim, baniu-lhes o nome, picou-lhes as armas de família, julgou tê-los calado para sempre. Mas tê-lo-á conseguido?

Uma personagem, Zenão, concentra em si o desejo de mudança, a vontade de alcançar, num mundo conturbado por conflitos vários, a liberdade de pensar e conceber.

Manuel Tiago,"Longe de veredas e povoações, a serra ondulava pedregosa e nua. Só aqui e além, ao fundo das encostas ou por detrás dos cabeços, repousavam manchas macias de terra lavrada. Donde e quem vinha lavrá-la parecia mistério em sítio tão desolado e ermo. Toda a tarde caminharam, o Lambaça adiante, André atrás. Nem uma só vez avistaram um ser humano. Não fora o sol derramando luz no ar e nas coisas, não fora o ar límpido e leve, aquele deserto e aquele silêncio seriam intoleravelmente opressivos. Assim, a serra abria-se à intimidade, numa carícia tranquila e confiante. 
Mas, quando o sol começou a aproximar-se do horizonte, e os vales se diluíram em penumbras, e os cabeços e rebolos estenderam as sombras, e o ar começou a pesar de humidade e frio, então, sobranceira, a serra ganhou subitamente nova grandeza, como que olhando os intrusos com hostilidade.

A verdadeira identidade de Manuel Tiago só foi confirmada aquando da publicação deste último romance. Durante anos, muito se especulou acerca da autoria das obras.

Manuel Pinheiro Chagas,"[http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/hist...](http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/historia-alegre-de-portugal/)
João Agualva, professor aposentado, decide relatar de forma fácil e didática a História do país a um grupo de saloios da sua aldeia natal, situada entre Belas e o Cacém. Da época de Viriato à Reconquista da Península Ibérica, da fundação de Portugal aos Descobrimentos, ele vai narrando, ao longo de dez serões, os momentos mais marcantes da História de Portugal, de forma descontraída, simplificada e divertida, culminando a sua narração no reinado de D. Luís I. 
Quando se tem a certeza de que se encontrou o caminho da Índia e vem um sujeito (Colombo) ter com o rei de Portugal, que está todo alegre com a descoberta, dizer-lhe: Faça favor de apagar tudo isso e de começar outra vez a procurar a Índia por outro lado. O rei, é claro, mandou-o pentear macacos. 
Publicada em 1880, esta obra de Manuel Pinheiro Chagas, tão divertida quanto didática, surgiu na mente do seu autor quando um colega deputado (na altura da monarquia constitucional) lhe ofereceu um livro francês intitulado: “Entretiens populaires sur l’histoire de France” – um pequeno livro que, de modo desprendido e usando uma linguagem prosaica, contava, muito concisamente, alguns episódios da história da França, de maneira a estes serem compreendidos pelo cidadão francês comum. Pinheiro Chagas achou tanta piada ao livro que se perguntou – tal como o próprio escreveu – “se não seria possível fazer, com relação à história portuguesa, um livro nesse género“. Dessa motivação surgiu então a “História Alegre de Portugal” uma obra mais rica em estilo narrativo que a congénere francesa pois é contada em forma de novela, na qual a História de Portugal serve de mote para o desenvolvimento narrativo da história central que tem um ex-professor como protagonista a contar ao um grupo de aldeões – descritos bem à maneira caricatural do “zé povinho” de Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, amigo de longa data de Pinheiro Chagas – a História do seu país que, curiosamente, lhes é completamente desconhecida. 
De chamar a atenção que esta obra de Manuel Pinheiro Chagas foi há uns anos atrás adaptada para uma versão em banda desenha, feita pelo desenhista Artur Correia.

Marguerite Duras,"Considerado o livro mais autobiográfico da escritora, dramaturga e cineasta Marguerite Duras (1914-1996), O amante, escrito em 1984, recebeu o Prêmio Goncourt, o mais importante da literatura francesa e se consagrou como sua obra mais célebre. O romance narra um episódio da adolescência de Duras: sua iniciação sexual, aos quinze anos e meio, com um chinês rico de Saigon. Se as personagens e fatos são verídicos, a escrita os transfigura e transcende; não sabemos em que medida a história é verdadeira. Os encontros amorosos são, ao mesmo tempo, intensamente prazerosos e infinitamente tristes; a vida da família contrapõe amor e ódio, miséria material e riqueza afetiva. A presença da mãe, sua desgraça financeira e moral, do irmão mais velho, drogado, cruel e venal, e do irmão mais novo, frágil e oprimido, constituem uma existência predominantemente triste, e por vezes trágica, de onde Duras extrai um esplendor artístico que se reflete em sua própria pessoa - personagem enigmática, quase de ficção. Tem sido dito que ler este livro é como folhear um álbum de fotografias - a narrativa se desenrola em torno de uma série de imagens fascinantes. Esse trabalho primoroso com as imagens também pode ser verificado nos mais de vinte filmes dirigidos por Duras e na possibilidade de seus textos se transformarem em filmes, como o fez Jean-Jacques Annaud com O amante em 1991. O livro integra a coleção Mulheres Modernistas - que já conta com O homem sentado no corredor e A doença da morte, volume que traz duas novelas da autora - e inclui posfácio de Leyla Perrone-Moisés e sugestões de leitura.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Marguerite Duras\O amante (2051)\cover.jpg,9788540506428,2014-11-25T12:14:56+00:00,Cosac Naify,4,The Lover,1.0,"Family Life, Fiction, Women, General, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros, Romance",O amante,2051

Depois de acordar ao lado do cadáver de Soraya - a mestiça belíssima, estrela televisiva, com quem mantinha uma relação íntima a pretexto de lhe escrever a autobiografia -, o jornalista desempregado Herculano Vermelho entrega-se à polícia e é preso. Não tem memória de nada, nem de que possa ter sido ele a matar a jovem mulher, mas a prisão parece-lhe ser o lugar ideal, o espaço de sossego e de liberdade (sem contas para pagar, sem apresentações regulares no centro de emprego, sem pressões de qualquer espécie), para passar a sua vida em revista, a relação com as mulheres, e escrever a autobiografia da rapariga morta.

Manuel Maria Rodrigues,"[http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/a-ro...](http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/a-rosa-do-adro/)
Rosa, é a mulher mais bela de uma aldeia situada “a cinco ou a seis léguas do Porto”, “no fundo montanhoso de uma colina” e sendo bela faz despertar a paixão dos homens que a cobiçam, sobretudo a de Fernando e António. Mas Fernando ganha o amor de Rosa, e António não, apesar de ser um homem que tanto é capaz de morrer por ela, como de por ela matar. 
A Rosa do Adro era a alegria e o enlevo de toda a gente. A rainha, o tudo daqueles lugares. 
Publicada pela primeira vez em 1870, A Rosa do Adro é a obra mais conhecida de Manuel Maria Rodrigues, um escritor que nunca teve o reconhecimento em vida que merecia, apesar deste seu livro ser um dos romance mais vendido do século XX em Portugal. 
Manuel Maria Rodrigues começou muito novo por ser tipógrafo nas oficinas do jornal “O Comércio do Porto” mas devido à sua sagacidade e talento natural para a escrita acabou com o tempo por ir subindo de posto, dentro do jornal, passando pela actividade de repórter, revisor, até chegar à de redactor efetivo. Esta posição gracejou-lhe tempo e meios para conseguir publicar alguns romances e operetas, tudo antes de atingir os 20 anos. Mas apesar de ser um escritor prolífero e talentoso nunca foi reconhecido como tal pelos críticos literários do seu tempo, habituados a obras mais eruditas e que desconsideravam romances de autores sem estatuto social e que continham histórias de amor provinciano, cheias de personagem prosaicas. 
O reconhecimento nacional do seu trabalho começou precisamente no ano da sua morte, quando em 1899 se levou uma adaptação deste seu romance, “A Rosa do Adro”, para o palco. O sucesso foi estrondoso. Tanto que, 17 anos depois, quando o cinema português (ainda na fase do filme mudo) andava à procura de uma história para levar para o grande ecrã, foi o romance de Manuel Maria Rodrigues o escolhido, tornado-se assim, em 1919, numa das primeira obras literárias portuguesas a ser adaptadas para o grande ecrã e numa das primeiras obras cinematográficas do cinema português. 
Mas a adaptação não terminaria aí. Em 1938 a obra foi novamente repescada para uma nova versão cinematográfica, desta vez em filme sonoro e mais fiel à história do romance, num filme que acabaria por ser o primeiro filme “remake” da história do cinema português. Tal como a versão anterior, o filme foi um estrondoso sucesso de bilheteira. 
Graças a todas estas adaptações, o romance “A Rosa do Adro” acabaria por ser constantemente re-editado, ao milhares, ao longo do século XX, servindo-se sempre das imagens iconográficas dos posters de promoção das peças de teatro e dos filmes para adornar as capas. A última re-edição do livro é de 2011 o que faz da obra um dos maiores best-sellers de ficção da literatura portuguesa (o maior, se retiramos os livros de leitura obrigatória nas escola como “Os Maias” ou o “Amor de Perdição”).

Manuel Da Silva Rosa,"No ano de 1444, perto da região onde outrora se erguera Constantinopla, um monarca cristão decidiu quebrar a sua trégua com os muçulmanos e conduzir os seus homens para o campo de batalha. O destino, porém, faz com que o seu exército seja dizimado, os mais fiéis companheiros sejam encontrados mortos e que este desapareça sem deixar rasto. Anos depois, na ilha da Madeira, mais de 3000 quilómetros a oeste, um misterioso cavaleiro de Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai casa-se com uma dama da elite portuguesa. . . e tem um filho. Essa criança ficaria para a história com um nome que é hoje conhecido em todo o mundo: Cristóvão Colombo. UMA CONSPIRAÇÃO REAL QUE VAI MUDAR O RUMO DA HISTÓRIA A vida de Colombo foi envolta num imenso mistério construído com o propósito de manter o mundo geral às escuras sobre a sua identidade, com exceção de uns poucos escolhidos, que sabiam da verdade. Aclamado herói nos seus dias, foi agraciado com fama e glória de tal forma, que poucos seres humanos o conseguiram suplantar. Mas quem era o homem ao qual chamamos Colombo e o que fazia em Castela? UM DOS MAIORES SEGREDOS DA EXPANSÃO MARÍTIMA PORTUGUESA Demorou 500 anos a construir uma mentira e duas décadas de investigação a desmascará-la. O «descobridor da América» pode bem ter sido o melhor agente duplo da História, porque conseguiu manter o seu segredo durante mais de cinco séculos. Na verdade, o homem que conhecemos como Cristóvão Colombo partiu de Portugal para Espanha, numa missão secreta ao serviço do rei D. João II, com o objetivo de enganar os Reis Católicos e proteger o monopólio do comércio marítimo português. Numa época tão épica e aventureira como a da expansão marítima, este é um verdadeiro jogo de espiões, manobras ocultas, conspirações, intrigas, traições, assassínios, fraudes, mentiras e enganos, perpetrado pelo génio de D. João II para tornar Portugal o primeiro império global.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Manuel Da Silva Rosa\Portugal E O Segredo De Colombo (2054)\cover.jpg,9789898907615,2019-02-15T12:31:33+00:00,Alma dos Livros,4,Os Pontos Cardeais,1.0,"Biographies & Memoirs, Autores Portugueses",Portugal E O Segredo De Colombo,2054

Com a sua publicação, Luis Sepúlveda quis de certo modo «encerrar» o capítulo da sua vida literária anterior a O Velho que Lia Romances de Amor, obra que, de um momento para o outro, em 1992, o transformou no caso mais sério da nova literatura latino-americana.  
A aventura e a política, o amor e a guerra, a viagem e a utopia, a ironia e o mistério: todo o mundo do autor, com as suas paixões e os seus temas (alguns, como o tema amoroso, presentes pela primeira vez com tanta intensidade), comparece neste notável livro de relatos, que vem confirmar a mestria do grande escritor chileno e a sua incontornável presença na primeira fila dos grandes contadores de histórias nossos contemporâneos.

Luis Sepúlveda,"Um dia, no campo de concentração de Bergen Belsen, na Alemanha, Luis Sepúlveda encontrou gravada numa pedra uma frase de autor anónimo que dizia: «Eu estive aqui e ninguém contará a minha história.» Essa frase trouxe-lhe à memória toda uma galeria de personagens excecionais que havia conhecido e cujas histórias mereciam ser contadas. 
Assim nasceu o presente livro, As Rosas de Atacama. «Histórias marginais» (aliás o título da edição original espanhola), e também histórias de marginais, os relatos que compõem esta obra têm todos os ingredientes a que Luis Sepúlveda habituou os seus leitores: a defesa da vida e da dignidade humana, a luta pela justiça, o elogio dos valores ecológicos, o exotismo como afirmação de que os sonhos são os mesmos em todos os lugares da Terra. Como em todos os livros de Sepúlveda, também neste a realidade supera a ficção.

Luís Miguel Rocha,"Luis Miguel Rocha, autor de O Ultimo Papa inicia a sua actividade literária com Um País Encantado que nos dá conta do Portugal moribundo no tempo do Estado Novo, mais precisamente na década de trinta. Um país suspenso no tempo, deslumbrado com o estrangeiro, pobre em recursos e ideias.  
Centrado numa família privilegiada, outras famílias se lhe juntam. Assistimos aos seus ódios, amores, perdas e cumplicidades num enredo em que o trágico e o absurdo se cruzam. Numa intriga cheia de humor, através do olhar lúcido do narrador, são desmascaradas situações gritantes de injustiça e de exploração em que o abuso de poder de alguns grupos privilegiados se passeia livremente por um país sonâmbulo e decadente com a cumplicidade silenciosa da Igreja. Também somos levados às terras do Brasil e às colónias portuguesas, às fazendas do café que deliciava o Pessoa no Chiado.

Lisa Bortolotti,"Poucas áreas da produção humana têm sido tão bem-sucedidas como a ciência. Os seus resultados manifestam-se em praticamente todos os aspectos da nossa vida quotidiana, tanto nos mais insignificantes como nos mais centrais e importantes. Porém, não tem sido fácil dizer o que há de tão especial na ciência para explicar de forma satisfatória tais resultados. Introdução à Filosofia da Ciência apresenta uma abordagem viva e acessível aos mais importantes temas e debates da actualidade nesta área. As questões filosóficas clássicas sobre a metodologia, o progresso, a racionalidade e a realidade são tratadas fazendo referência a exemplos de todo o espectro das ciências naturais e sociais. Lisa Bortolotti adopta uma perspectiva historicamente informada sobre a evolução da ciência, e inclui uma discussão minuciosa sobre as implicações éticas da investigação científica. É dedicada especial atenção à relação complexa entre o avanço da ciência, as políticas públicas e o interesse público, bem como à continuidade entre a investigação científica e as outras actividades humanas. O livro está estruturado de modo a ajudar o leitor a pensar por si mesmo, incluindo quadros informativos e perguntas para reflectir, com o intuito de apoiar também professores e estudantes em todas as fases do ensino e da aprendizagem, desde a compreensão dos textos primários e de textos secundários, à discussão e redacção de ensaios. Também inclui uma bibliografia temática e um glossário de termos técnicos. Uma Introdução à Filosofia da Ciência de Lisa Bortolotti

Lídia Jorge,"O Vento Assobiando nas Gruas é um livro ancorado sobre dois mundos - um mundo contemporâneo, envolvido com a transformação acelerada da Terra, movido pelo instinto selvagem de futuro, e um outro mais antigo, onde a história de uma velha fábrica se cruza com a sorte de uma família numerosa, recém-chegada de África. Dois mundos, à primeira vista irreconciliáveis, e no entanto, a aproximá-los, por obra do acaso, caminha desde a primeira página a figura de Milene Leandro, a rapariga singular, para quem tudo nasce pela primeira vez, e que, na simplicidade do seu juízo, acabará por obrigar os outros à revelação de si mesmos. Figura central, é precisamente através das mãos de Milene que o leitor entra na primeira página, e é ainda com ela que encerra a última, depois de ter conhecido a suas expensas o caso de um amor, de um crime e de um silêncio para sempre selado. Por isso mesmo, o seu olhar desprevenido sobre a vida, o bem e o mal, assim como a avaliação que faz deste mundo, constituem a verdadeira matéria orgânica que constrói este livro.

Lindsey Davis,"Roma, ano 89 DC. As regras ditam que uma mulher deve ser submissa e modesta. Não deve levantar a voz, vestir roupas extravagantes, sair à noite, beber ou desafiar a autoridade… e muito menos envolver-se em assuntos criminais. Flávia Albia contraria todas estas normas (e mais algumas). Vive sozinha na zona boémia de Roma, cultiva amizades pouco recomendáveis e não se coíbe de lutar pelos seus direitos. Filha de um detetive, Flávia decidiu desde cedo seguir os passos do pai. Mas a investigação é uma profissão masculina. Para ser respeitada, ela sabe que terá de ser a mais rápida, a mais perspicaz, a melhor. Flávia é a única a reparar que o número de mortes inexplicáveis tem vindo a aumentar na cidade. Por não terem ligação entre si nem indícios de violência, não levantaram suspeitas. As denúncias de Flávia são ignoradas pelas autoridades, que estão demasiado ocupadas com a organização dos Jogos de Ceres, o momento alto do ano. E até mesmo a própria Flávia, distraída com a perspetiva de um novo romance, não vê que a morte está demasiado perto de casa…

Lídia Jorge,"Mais conhecida como romancista, Lídia Jorge, uma das grandes damas da literatura portuguesa contemporânea, ganha finalmente uma antologia de contos à altura de seu talento e importância. Selecionados por Marlise Vaz Bridi, professora de Literatura Portuguesa da Universidade de São Paulo, os textos são inéditos no Brasil. Os contos de Lídia Jorge se destacam pelos motivos aparentemente simples, ao mesmo tempo em que demonstram a qualidade da construção das narrativas por meio da precisão da linguagem, da escolha do ponto de vista que amplifica ambiguidades e sugestões, pelo fino desenho das personagens e dos ambientes e, sobretudo, pela articulação entre a subjetividade do mundo ficcional com a objetivação do mundo real. Segundo a organizadora, ""se tais qualidades de Lídia Jorge não são exclusividade de seus contos, sem dúvida eles são uma oportunidade privilegiada para verificar o 'tremor de água dentro de um cristal' que cada uma dessas narrativas podem produzir."" Selecionados entre os volumes Marido e outros contos (1997), O belo adormecido (2004) e Praça de Londres (2008), os contos de Lídia Jorge são uma oportunidade de contato com uma nova vertente da obra desta escritora que, através de uma escrita por diversos aspectos tão bem arquitetada, resultará certamente numa visão mais complexa e reveladora da própria humanidade. Lídia Jorge nasceu em 1946, no Algarve, obtendo destaque e reconhecimento desde o seu romance de estreia, O dia dos prodígios (1980).

Lídia Jorge,"Trata-se da obra mais intimista da autora. Também a mais próxima de uma perspectiva feminista, já que nesta ficção a figura da mulher é perspectivada sob um ângulo de irónico ressentimento. A Última Dona relata o encontro, num lugar recôndito, da jovem Anita Starlet com um homem de meia-idade, o Engenheiro Geraldes, e da viagem que ambos fazem ao âmago das suas vidas, num ambiente de fuga e clandestinidade proporcionado pelo isolamento da Casa do Leborão.
Do confronto entre os dois personagens, resulta uma parábola sobre o desafio da paixão levada aos seus extremos, vivida sob a aparência duma existência normal, e sobre os limites do conhecimento do outro. Editado pelas Publicações Dom Quixote, em 1992, este foi um livro que agitou opiniões e dividiu pareceres em torno da autora.

Lídia Jorge,"Há uma pergunta que percorre este romance de Lídia Jorge, da primeira à última página: Quantas vítimas se deixa pelo caminho para se perseguir um objectivo? A acção do romance decorre no final dos anos 80 do século XX e invoca um tema de inesperada audácia - o da força da idolatria e a construção do êxito - visto a partir do interior de um grupo, narrado 21 anos mais tarde, na forma de um monólogo. Como é habitual na obra da autora, a questão social é relevante - a força do todo e a aniquilação do indivíduo perante o colectivo são temas presentes neste livro. Mas aqui, tratando-se de um grupo fechado e dominado pela música, a parábola social submerge perante a descrição de um ambiente de grande envolvimento humano e de densidade poética. Servido por uma narrativa ao mesmo tempo rude e mágica, A Noite das Mulheres Cantoras propõe a quem o lê a história de seis figuras que passam a viver para sempre no nosso imaginário.

Como protegida da família Santana era obrigada a aceitar todos os caprichos de Catarina Santana, a sua madrinha e benfeitora. Ostensivamente rejeitada pelas amigas da madrinha, dá como perdido o tempo passado em eventos do género, um após outro e sempre que consegue, escapa-se para algum canto da casa, onde não a encontrem. E é o que faz, minutos depois de dar de caras com Ricardo Santana, conhecido como mulherengo e outros epítetos inpronunciáveis.   
Quando, minutos depois, se senta no caramanchão de rosas de cheiro para fumar um cigarro, depara-se de novo com ele, e com toda a sua capacidade de sedução. A partir desse dia, um conjunto de acontecimentos diabólicos, surgindo em catadupa alteram toda a concepção de vida de Helena, sem que ela possa fazer nada para os inverter, até que um dia, quando ela menos esperava... surge um outro homem que pagara por ela, para a possuir por inteiro.

Lewis Carroll,"""As aventuras de Alice no País das Maravilhas"" foi lançado em 1865 e até hoje conquista legiões de fãs pelo mundo. Em parte, porque abre várias linhas de leitura e interpretação possíveis, além de ser repleto de referências e críticas sobre a cultura da época. Lewis Carroll é considerado precursor e um dos maiores impulsionadores da literatura nonsense, um gênero literário que subverte os contos de fadas tradicionais, criando narrativas que não seguem as regras da lógica. É precisamente nesse caráter de absurdo que parece estar a singularidade da obra, que se tornou um ícone literário e cultural.

After a feud with his commander he defects to the Russians, only to find that he is now trusted by neither side.

Leo Tolstoy,"Com centenas de personagens e mais de mil páginas na versão original, Guerra e paz é considerado um dos maiores romances da história. O enredo deste clássico da literatura russa se passa durante a campanha de Napoleão na Áustria, e descreve a invasão da Rússia pelo exército francês e a sua retirada, compreendendo o período de 1805 a 1820.Trata-se de um painel profundo e verdadeiro da aristocracia russa, pois foi escrito por alguém de dentro dela. As duas principais famílias retratadas - Rostov e Bolkonski - representam as famílias Tolstói e Volkonski, respectivamente do pai e da mãe do autor, Liev Tolstói. Guerra e paz retrata ainda o preconceito e a hipocrisia da nobreza, e também suas tradições religiosas, ao lado da vida cotidiana dos soldados e dos servos.Ambientado na Rússia do início do século XIX, o romance lida com temas essenciais à vida contemporânea: a guerra e a paz. Tolstói narra as guerras entre o imperador francês Napoleão e as principais monarquias da Europa, dissecando causas, origens e conseqüências dos conflitos e, principalmente, expondo os homens e suas fraquezas.AddThis Sharing Buttons",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Leo Tolstoy\Guerra E Paz (2118)\cover.jpg,9781535270984,2016-07-13T13:51:31+01:00,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,4,,1.0,"War, Clássicos Europa-América, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros",Guerra E Paz,2118

Por sua vez, «O Padre Sérgui» retrata a vida de um soldado que, para resistir às tentações, se torna monge e, mais tarde, pedinte. Dos restantes contos, destaca-se «Depois do Baile» que é, nas palavras de George Steiner, um «conto formidável», um «exemplo em que a técnica e a metafísica se tornaram inseparáveis», pois no «vocabulário de Tolstói, um baile tem ressonâncias ambíguas, é ao mesmo tempo uma ocasião de graça e elegância e um símbolo de consumada artificialidade».",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Liev Tolstoi\O DIABO E OUTROS CONTOS (2119)\cover.jpg,9789896410407,2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,RELOGIO D'AGUA,4,,1.0,,O DIABO E OUTROS CONTOS,2119

Leo Tolstoy, known to the world for his famous novels, also created throughout his sixty-year career as a writer a significant body of works of shorter ficiton. These fictions, like his novels, tend toward a uniqueness in form, even as they explore a set of themes common in the longer works. The four novellas selected here stand closest to the novels, and represent Tolstoy at his creative best, exploring in a specific and focused way his characteristic themes: life understood as a journey of the discovery of identity and vocation, the meaning of one's life in the face of death, and the redemptive role of suffering and compassion. Family Happiness (1859) traces the psychology of failed married love yet is written against the tradition of the novel of romance, marriage and adultery. The Kreutzer Sonata (1889) recounts a husband's addictions, jealousy, sinister guilt and subsequent isolation, while The Cossacks (1863) focuses on the experiences of a young Russian on in the Caucusus whose quest for romantic love becomes one for the love of 'the whole of God's world'. Finally, the superbly crafted Hadji Murád (1905) juxtaposes the military and civilian worlds, and relates a tale of the human violation of the natural through a series of parallel episodes. Written over a period of almost fifty years, these works display Tolstoy's changing views on art and sexuality, women and marriage, nationalism and ethnicity, war and empire. All four novellas develop, each in its own unique way, the central Tolystoyan theme of love. This edition, which updates a classic translation, has explanatory notes and a substantial introduction based on the most recent scholarship in the field.

Leila Slimani,"PRÉMIO GONCOURT 2016  Uma obra magistral sobre o pior pesadelo de quem é pai: a morte dos filhos.Um romance que conquistou a crítica literária internacional e mais de 500 mil leitores em todo o mundo. Mãe de duas crianças pequenas, Myriam decide retomar a actividade profissional num escritório de advogados, apesar das reticências do marido. Depois do minucioso processo de selecção de uma ama, o casal escolhe Louise. A ama rapidamente conquista o coração dos pequenos Adam e Mila e a admiração dos pais, tornando-se uma figura imprescindível na casa da jovem família. O que Myriam e Paul não suspeitam - ou o que não querem ver - é que a sua pequena família é o único vínculo de Louise à normalidade. Pouco a pouco, o afecto e a atenção vão dando lugar a uma interdependência sufocante, com o cerco a apertar-se a cada dia, até desembocar num drama irremediável. Com um olhar incisivo sobre esta pequena família, Leïla Slimani aponta o foco para um palco maior: a sociedade moderna, com as suas debilidades e contradições. Com uma escrita cirúrgica e tensa, eivada de um lirismo enigmático, o mistério instala-se desde a primeira página, um mistério que é tanto sobre as razões do drama desta família como o das profundezas insondáveis da alma humana. Os elogios da crítica: «Leïla Slimani orienta toda a sua capacidade de inquisição às relações domésticas. O romance agarra o leitor com uma força incrível, que deve tanto à mestria da narração como a uma escrita seca, clínica, precisa.»Le Monde «A violência e a ausência de sentimentalismo são as marcas de fabrico das histórias imaginadas pela autora. Este livro faz de Slimani a cronista de um modo de vida contemporâneo: a vida de casais na casa dos quarenta, citadinos, educados e bem na vida.»Libération «Leïla Slimani apresenta, com uma mestria excepcional, uma tragédia social fascinante, inquietante, edificante. Uma cruel canção de embalar, Canção doce expõe, num quadro íntimo do quotidiano, a relação entre senhor e escravo. Um grande livro.»La Croix «Um romance magistral e aterrador.»Lire «Fica-se fascinado com a força e o talento de Leïla Slimani para descrever a humanidade naquilo que ela tem de insondável.»Page «Um feito digno de nota e uma confirmação de Leïla Slimani como uma escritora de grande talento.»Le Point «Uma força que seduz e que permanece no leitor muito tempo depois de fechar o livro.»La République",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Leila Slimani\Cancao doce (2123)\cover.jpg,9789896653729,2017-12-18T12:22:46+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,3,,1.0,"Fiction, Thriller, Contemporary, General, Literary, Mystery",Canção doce,2123

A distância entre o atirador e o alvo era extraordinária. Quantos atiradores podem disparar a mais de um quilómetro de distância com total confiança? Muito poucos, mas John Kott, um atirador americano que descarrilou, é um deles. E depois de quinze anos na prisão, está em liberdade e atento a uma reunião dos G8, tentadora para qualquer assassino. Se existe alguém que consegue deter Kott, esse alguém é o homem que já anteriormente o venceu: Reacher. E embora preferisse trabalhar sozinho, Reacher é destacado com Casey Nice, uma analista viciada em Zoloft. Mas enfrentam um caminho sinuoso, cheio de mafiosos implacáveis e criminosos sérvios, e estão por sua conta e risco caso sejam apanhados. Durante todo esse tempo, Reacher não consegue parar de pensar na mulher que em tempos não conseguiu salvar. Mas não vai permitir que isso se repita. Desta vez, não. Reacher nunca se aproxima demais. Mas há agora um assassino que tornou a questão pessoal.

Lawrence Durrell,"Pela primeira vez em Portugal, a edição reunida e revista pelo autor, em 1962, dos quatro livros que compõem O Quarteto de Alexandria - Justine, Balthazar, Mountolive e Clea. Os quatro romances exploram a sociedade daquela cidade poliglota e cosmopolita, repleta de intrigas, mistério e sensualidade, retomando genericamente uma mesma história sob diferentes pontos de vista, acrescentando e refazendo pormenores e situações. Justine, o primeiro livro da tetralogia, centra-se na bela esposa judia de Nessim, um poderoso banqueiro copta, narrando, do ponto de vista de um jovem aspirante a escritor, os encontros e desencontros de um grupo de amigos que se conhecem na cidade de Alexandria no período anterior à Segunda Guerra Mundial. Darley, o narrador, envolve-se com duas mulheres - a misteriosa Justine e a frágil Melissa. A partir desta complexa relação, nasce uma trama carregada de erotismo e subtilezas. Em Balthazar o narrador, isolado numa ilha onde vive com a pequena filha de Melissa, recebe a inesperada visita de Balthazar, que lhe entrega o manuscrito de Justine. Relendo o seu próprio texto e os comentários do amigo, Darley revive o seu envolvimento com as mulheres do seu passado e toma conhecimento de novos factos. Em Mountolive, o terceiro livro de O Quarteto de Alexandria, o autor apresenta os acontecimentos narrados em Justine e Balthazar sob uma nova perspetiva. A guerra faz a sua aparição e a trama gira agora em torno do embaixador britânico, David Mountolive, tendo como ponto de partida as recordações da sua paixão por Leila, a mãe de Nessim. Darley regressa a Alexandria a pedido de Nessim, levando a menina para que o pai e Justine a conheçam.

Ela não acredita que os nazis vão invadir a França… mas é isso mesmo que fazem, em batalhões de soldados em marcha, em caravanas de camiões e tanques, em aviões que enchem os céus e largam as suas bombas por cima dos inocentes. Quando um capitão alemão reclama a casa de Vianne, ela e a filha passam a ter de viver com o inimigo, sob risco de virem a perder tudo o que têm. Sem comida, dinheiro ou esperança, e à medida que a escalada de perigo as cerca cada vez mais, é obrigada a tomar decisões impossíveis, uma atrás da outra, de forma a manter a família viva. Isabelle, a irmã de Vianne, é uma rebelde de dezoito anos, que procura um objetivo de vida com toda a paixão e ousadia da juventude. Enquanto milhares de parisienses marcham para os horrores desconhecidos da guerra, ela conhece Gäetan, um partisan convicto de que a França é capaz de derrotar os nazis a partir do interior. Isabelle apaixona-se como só acontece aos jovens… perdidamente. Mas quando ele a trai, ela junta-se à Resistência e nunca olha para trás, arriscando vezes sem conta a própria vida para salvar a dos outros.

Knut Hamsun,"O principal personagem dos romances de Knust Hamsun é o próprio autor refletido em várias projeções de si mesmo. De seu sofrimento - e como conheceu ele todas as gamas e cores do infortúnio! - extraiu o sentido e a filosofia, bem como o enredo e a história dos livros que escreveu. Em 'Fome' se encontra especialmente o escritor confundido com o seu personagem. Tudo quanto ele define aquele intelectual - suas aspirações e amores, seus sonhos e descrenças, suas alegrias e choques - aparece nesse romance de fato sedutor, na verdade único, em que o 'pobre diabo' se apresenta aos nossos olhos não como uma ciratura caída em abjeção, em dissolvência moral, mas como alguém de quem se deve compadecer e lastimar e ao mesmo tempo admirar ou até mesmo invejar. Foi o exercício da vagabundagem - no caso um fecundo laboratório em que o romancista colheu as suas experiências dos homens e do mundo para definir a sua própria personalidade.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Knut Hamsun\Fome (2146)\cover.jpg,9788531907166,1963-02-15T12:47:35+00:00,Ed.

Khaled Hosseini,"After 103 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and with four million copies of The Kite Runner shipped, Khaled Hosseini returns with a beautiful, riveting, and haunting novel that confirms his place as one of the most important literary writers today. 
Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. 
Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them—in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul—they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival. 
A stunning accomplishment, A Thousand Splendid Suns is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.

Karl Polanyi,"«Em 1944, Karl Polanyi publicou A Grande Transformação: as origens políticas e económicas do nosso tempo, obra em que analisou a estrutura do capitalismo no século XIX a partir de uma tese inovadora, de cariz marcadamente institucional e político: a Inglaterra não fora transformada apenas pela máquina a vapor, nem sequer pelas anteriores expansão do comércio mundial e revolução agrícola; não fora a industrialização per se que desencadeara os processos de conflito e de desorganização social que marcaram o longo século XIX. A miríade de motins, revoltas, movimentos genéricos de protesto, revoluções sociais e ciclos intensos e recorrentes de violência a estes associados e que caracterizaram as eras da revolução, do capital e do império, resultaram também da emergência de um conjunto de propostas intelectuais - de Ricardo a James Mill, passando por Marx -, progressivamente desenvolvidas no interior de instituições sociais várias, que postularam a prevalência do mercado enquanto forma histórica primordial de organização da sociedade. A Grande Transformação consistiu sim, essencialmente, na extensão do sistema de mercados a todas as esferas da vida humana, cuja lei da oferta e da procura passou a determinar autonomamente a afetação e a remuneração de fatores de produção como a terra (a natureza) - e o trabalho (ou seja, a própria utilização da vida humana). Assim, a principal preocupação de Polanyi foi a de demonstrar como se formaram historicamente, primeiro, os mercados nacionais e internacionais e, nesta sequência, como se passou de uma configuração caracterizada por trocas livres para uma outra, marcada por um intenso controlo político e social, em reação à grande crise de 1929 (...). Da mesma forma que o capitalismo, com os seus mercados autorregulados e a lógica de uma economia orientada para a satisfação em bens materiais, levara à desagregação da vida em comunidade, criando a denominada ""grande transformação"", sentiu-se mais tarde, devido às consequências nocivas",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Karl Polanyi\A Grande Transformacao (2165)\cover.jpg,9789724417592,2013-07-30T13:50:56+01:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"General, Business & Economics, Autores Estrangeiros",A Grande Transformação,2165

E que só o encontra no Caminho de Santiago. Amit é americano, está na Índia, leva consigo as cinzas do pai, para as libertar nas águas do Rio Ganges. Amargurado, triste, chegou a um ponto em que nada parece fazer sentido. Não acredita em Deus, na meditação, no trabalho ou no amor.

Júlio Magalhães,"António nasceu marcado pelo nome. O mesmo que o vizinho da rua das traseiras, o homem que se fez doutor em Coimbra e que ia à terra sempre que podia, o tal que governava o país com pulso de ferro. Mas de pouco ou nada lhe valeu tão grande nome quando o destino o enviou para Angola, para defender a pátria em nome de uma guerra distante que não era a sua. Deixou para trás a sua terra, a mãe inconsolável e Amélia, a mulher que pedira em casamento, num banco de pedra, junto à igreja e que prometera fazer dele o homem mais feliz de Vimieiro. Promessa gravada num enxoval imaculado que ficou guardado no armário, à espera do fim daquela maldita guerra. Quando António regressou de Angola, era um homem diferente. Marcado no corpo por anos de guerra e de cativeiro e no coração por um amor impossível que deixara em pleno mato angolano. Regressava para cumprir a promessa que fizera anos antes à sua noiva Amélia, que o julgara morto, e que, em sua memória, tinha enterrado um caixão sem corpo.

Júlio Dinis,"A antologia de contos e novelas curtas de Júlio Dinis. São elas: “O Espólio do Senhor Cipriano”, “Justiça de Sua Majestade”; “As Apreensões de uma Mãe”, “Os Novelos da Tia Filomena”; “Uma Flor entre o Gelo” e “O Canto da Sereia”. 
Publicado pela primeira vez em 1870, a obra “Serões da Província” é uma compilação de contos e curtas novelas que Júlio Dinis publicou em folhetim no Jornal do Porto, entre 1862 e 1864. 
Os temas e motivos destes contos e novelas são predominantes os mesmos que se encontram na obra romanesca do autor e que o definem. Júlio Dinis viu sempre o mundo pelo prisma da fraternidade, do optimismo, dos sentimentos sadios do amor e da esperança e isso reflete-se na sua obra escrita. 
“O Espólio do Senhor Cipriano”, conta-se a história de Cipriano Martins, um homem com fama de avarento que, na hora da sua morte, deixa a irmã sem meios para lhe providenciar um funeral condigno. 
“As Apreensões de uma Mãe” narra a história de amor entre dois enamorados separados pelo estatuto social e pelas oposição D. Margarida, preocupada com o futuro académico do seu filho Tomás. 
“Os Novelos da Tia Filomela” é uma história de superstições populares acerca de uma mulher injustamente acusada de ser uma bruxa. 
“Uma Flor entre o Gelo” aborda o caso curioso da loucura de um velho médico apaixonado, que decai da fé positiva na medicina na procura do elixir da longa vida. 
“O Canto da Sereia” conta a história de um jovem pescador que se apaixona por uma voz que lhe chega do mar em noites tormentosas. 
A novela “Justiça de Sua Majestade” tem uma particularidade: foi a primeira novela escrita por Júlio Dinis, em 1858, quando tinha 19 anos. O seu editor da altura, no entanto, não gostou da história e negou-se a publica-lo. Tal facto desencorajou Júlio Dinis de tal maneira que só apresentaria um novo romance (As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor) dez anos depois. A história seria depois acrescentada a “Serões da Província” a partir da terceira edição, já depois da morte prematura de Júlio Dinis e a pedido do pai dele. A ação da história gira em torno de encontros amorosos e fugazes, mas intensos, que ocorrem entre dois casais na corte da rainha D. Maria II.: A antologia de contos e novelas curtas de Júlio Dinis

Júlio Dinis,"(Ilustrado) A história dos amores e dos desencontros das órfãs Clara e Guida educadas por um velho pároco, no cenário da vida campestre portuguesa do século XIX. Cenário este, povoado por personagens cuja bondade só é maculada pelo moralismo quase ingénuo de “comadres intriguistas” que contribuem para o conflito amoroso. 
Lançado ao público em formato de folhetim de jornal em 1863 e, posteriormente, editado e publicado como livro em 1867, o primeiro romance de Júlio Dinis “As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor” encontram-se não só entre as obras de maior sucesso do autor, como é também um dos romance mais vendidos dos séculos XIX e XX em Portugal. 
Parte desse êxito encontra-se, em parte, no estilo literário empregue, muito afastado da escrita erudita e rebuscada de outros romances da época. Utilizando o uso de chavões, expressões e descrição de costumes rurais, é visível que a obra foi claramente dirigida à classe popular – um modelo de escrita posteriormente usado por muitos outros autores. 
No entanto, não há neste romance, tal como em nenhum dos outros romances de Júlio Dinis, uma incursão no estilo realista ou naturalista – movimentos que ganhavam elevo nos círculos literários da altura -, muito pelo contrário. Júlio Dinis apresenta-nos a sua visão bucólica, pitoresca e romântica da vida, não descrevendo as dificuldades da vida campesina, não fazendo denúncias de foro social ou criticando costumes e mentalidades, como fazia Eça de Queirós, praticamente na mesma altura. No entanto, o romance, “As pupilas do Sr. Reitor” tal como os seguintes, revela um profundo conhecimento do autor relativamente a hábitos locais, expressões e costumes próprios do cenário que descreve, isto porque Júlio Dinis criava efetivamente narrativas de lugares que conhecia e amava, (neste caso, a zona de Ovar), sem quaisquer pretensões de agitar ou modelar consciências mas apenas de entreter e de deleitar.

Publicado em 1870, Vinte mil léguas submarinas é uma das obras de aventura quintessenciais da literatura ocidental. Mais do que isso, o francês Jules Verne ajudou a estabelecer um tipo de romance que, sem abrir mão por um segundo da mais eletrizante carga de entretenimento, apresentava e discutia as principais questões que norteavam o conhecimento científico de seu tempo. E ia além, perscrutando o futuro. A aventura começa quando Dr. Pierre Arronax é convidado pelo Secretário da Marinha dos Estados Unidos a participar de uma expedição de pesquisa naval a bordo do Abraham Lincoln. O objetivo é encontrar um monstro marinho, avistado no Oceano Pacífico. Durante o confronto, Arronax, seu criado Conseil e o arpoador canadense Ned Land são lançados ao mar, para serem subsequentemente resgatados pelo submarino do capitão Nemo, o Nautilus. Narrado por Arronax, o livro é um vasto passeio pelos oceanos do mundo e suas maravilhas submarinas, descritas em detalhes por Verne. Não é apenas a tecnologia que o interessa, mas também a fauna e a geografia marítimas, tudo reforçado em seu maravilhamento da imaginação - como no episódio da luta da tripulação do Nautilus contra uma lula gigante.

Jules Verne,"Instead of linking two seas, as existing canals (the Suez and the Panama) did, Verne proposed a canal that would create a sea in the heart of the Sahara Desert. The story raises a host of environmental, cultural and political concerns. The proposed sea threatens the nomadic way of life of those Islamic tribes living on the site, and they declare war. The ensuing struggle is finally resolved only by a cataclysmic natural event. This Wesleyan edition features notes, appendices and an introduction by Verne scholar Arthur B. Evans, as well as reproductions of the illustrations from the original French edition.

Jules Verne,"By too many people Jules Verne is considered only as a master of that form of fiction which is based upon intelligent anticipation of the progress of mechanical invention. As time goes on and one after another his forecasts in this direction are justified by the event, it is likely that he will be remembered as a prophet rather than as a romancer, which is his real claim to distinction. For in imaginative fiction what is required of the writer is not verity but verisimilitude, and the supreme merit of such books as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""The Clipper of the Clouds"" is not that submarine and aircraft have now been proved to be possible but that they were made to seem probable then. Above all things else Jules Verne was a master of the art of writing the adventure story and his greatness is most apparent in his simplest work. 
In ""The Lighthouse at the End of the World,"" Jules Verne is seen at his simplest and best. No antecedent improbability here has to be made good. The remoteness of the scene where the drama is laid supplies an element of dread of which advantage is skillfully taken, and the shortness of the period over which the story is extended adds excitement to the race against time which the villains of the piece are compelled to make in their attempt to escape justice. The rest is pure action, courage and resourcefulness pitted against ferocity and power of numbers, with no merely invented complications to retard the issue. As a simple adventure story ""The Lighthouse at the End of the World"" must be declared a little masterpiece.

No romance estão patentes alguns dos conflitos entre o império britânico e os colonos holandeses naquela região de África, que foram o gérmen da segunda guerra dos bóeres.

Para piorar as coisas, vivia na penúria, o tio era um bêbado e a mãe uma senhora de temperamento irascível. Não, ninguém diria que seria ela a casar com o abastado, mulherengo e arrogante Jordan Townsende, duque de Hawthorne.  
Mas a verdade é que, devido a um infeliz mal-entendido, assim foi.  
Alexandra é agora duquesa, mas a sua vida é tudo menos calma. Quatro dias após o casamento, o marido desaparece sem deixar rasto. É sozinha que tem de enfrentar a sociedade londrina, que despreza o facto de um dos ""seus"" aristocratas ter casado com uma campónia ingénua. Quando Jordan finalmente reaparece, Alexandra já perdeu a inocência dos seus dezassete anos, mas aos poucos vai descobrir que, por detrás da fachada gélida do marido, está um homem ternurento, amável e sensual. Tragicamente, Jordan coleccionou demasiados inimigos e é agora um alvo a abater. Caberá a Alexandra salvar a vida do homem que ama. Uma missão impossível não fosse a sua teimosia em acreditar que o futuro lhes reserva… algo maravilhoso.

José Saramago,"Edição especial em e-book com ilustrações de Juergen Cannes. Um homem vai ao rei e lhe pede um barco para viajar até uma ilha desconhecida. O rei lhe pergunta como pode saber que essa ilha existe, já que é desconhecida. O homem argumenta que assim são todas as ilhas até que alguém desembarque nelas. Este pequeno conto de José Saramago pode ser lido como uma parábola do sonho realizado, isto é, como um canto de otimismo em que a vontade ou a obstinação fazem a fantasia ancorar em porto seguro. Antes, entretanto, ela é submetida a uma série de embates com o status quo, com o estado consolidado das coisas, como se da resistência às adversidades viesse o mérito e do mérito nascesse o direito à concretização. Entre desejar um barco e tê-lo pronto para partir, o viajante vai de certo modo alterando a idéia que faz de uma ilha desconhecida e de como alcançá-la, e essa flexibilidade com certeza o torna mais apto a obter o que sonhou.

José Saramago,"O caderno, reunião dos textos de Saramago postados quase diariamente em seu blog entre setembro de 2008 e março de 2009, é mais do que uma simples coletânea de crônicas jornalísticas. É um relato de vida, um diário intelectual e sentimental do único prêmio Nobel de literatura em língua portuguesa. Na ""página branca da internet"", o autor conta o que o motiva, o que o indigna ou o que lhe apetece. Comenta o minuto, mas também recupera uma declaração de amor a Lisboa. Fala dos seus autores preferidos, com humor define as calças sempre impecavelmente vincadas de Carlos Fuentes, mas também o universo turbulento dos turcos de Jorge Amado descobrindo a América. Fala do papa, de Garzón, e de Pessoa; de Sigifredo López e Rosa Parks; e de tantos lutadores pacíficos que conseguiram mudar o mundo ou estão tentando. E emociona-se com gente, com amigos, com pormenores... São seis meses de vida contados em cartas inteligentes, porém diretas, sem artifícios. Mas antes e acima de tudo, Saramago parece ter encontrado nesse lugar indefinido, em que todos talvez sejamos iguais, a plena e direta realização de algo que sempre distinguiu sua obra e sua postura pública: a firme tomada de opiniões e a indignação ante a injustiça. A lucidez, a inconformidade e a relevância desses relatos pediam a transformação da instantaneidade do blog naquele tempo plácido dos livros, o que é agora materializado neste Caderno.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jose Saramago\O caderno (2214)\cover.jpg,9788580863444,2009-07-17T13:22:19+01:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,"Biography, Essays, Writing, Literary Collections, Autores Portugueses",O caderno,2214

José Saramago,"Terminado em 1953 e inédito até depois da morte do autor, Claraboia narra com aguda percepção psicológica o dia a dia e as angústias dos moradores de um modesto prédio de apartamentos em Lisboa, e revela um Saramago em pleno domínio da narrativa. Primavera de 1952. Um prédio de seis apartamentos numa rua modesta de Lisboa é o cenário principal das histórias simultâneas que compõem este romance da juventude de José Saramago. Os dramas cotidianos dos moradores - donas de casa, funcionários remediados, trabalhadores manuais - tecem uma trama multifacetada, repleta de elementos do consagrado estilo da maturidade do escritor, em especial a maestria dos diálogos e o poder de observação psicológica. As janelas, paredes e corredores do velho edifício lisboeta são testemunhas privilegiadas das pequenas tragédias e comédias representadas pelos personagens. As peripécias de Lídia, uma bela mulher sustentada pelo amante misterioso, e Abel, um jovem outsider à procura de um sentido para a vida, se contrapõem ao árduo cotidiano dos outros moradores. As narrativas paralelas do livro são organizadas segundo as divisões internas do prédio, do térreo ao segundo andar. No início da década de 1950, José Saramago já não era um nome totalmente desconhecido na cena literária portuguesa. Aos trinta anos, o futuro vencedor do prêmio Nobel publicara um romance - Terra do pecado (1947) -, e alguns de seus contos haviam saído em jornais e revistas de Lisboa, às vezes assinados com o pseudônimo ""Honorato"". Saramago, ex-serralheiro mecânico e então um modesto funcionário da previdência social, também possuía diversos poemas e peças de teatro entre seus inéditos. Até 1953, o escritor iniciaria a redação de mais quatro romances, que ficaram inacabados. Em 5 de janeiro daquele ano ""Honorato"" finalizava o datiloscrito de um livro de mais de trezentas páginas. O novo romance, em seguida encaminhado para publicação a uma editora lisboeta por intermédio de um amigo jornalista, acabaria esquecido no fundo de uma gaveta. O original nunca foi devolvido ao seu autor, que também não recebera resposta alguma. Na década de 1980, o já consagrado José Saramago era contactado pela mesma editora para publicar Claraboia. A mágoa pela falta de resposta na juventude levou-o a declarar que não desejaria ver o romance editado em vida, deixando para seus herdeiros a decisão sobre o que fazer com o livro. Após seu desaparecimento, as inquestionáveis qualidades do romance, construído com perfeito domínio do espaço narrativo, justificam plenamente a opção de trazê-lo a público.

A primeira parte, centrada na pessoa José Saramago, reúne comentários sobre sua infância, a formação autodidata, a trajetória pessoal, os lugares onde morou, bem como reflexões sobre si mesmo que traçam o perfil de um escritor sempre disposto a praticar a introspecção e a compartilhar seu pensamento com a opinião pública. A segunda parte traz reflexões sobre o ofício literário que mostram sua consciência dos procedimentos romanescos, concepções pouco ortodoxas para um comunista sobre as relações entre literatura e política e o papel do escritor na sociedade. Na terceira parte, quem fala é o cidadão José de Sousa Saramago, o crítico, entre outras coisas, da globalização econômica, do 'concubinato' dos meios de comunicação com o poder, do consumismo do conservadorismo da Igreja católica, da postura de Israel em relação aos palestinos e do irracionalismo generalizado do mundo capitalista.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jose Saramago\As palavras de Saramago_ catalogo d (2225)\cover.jpg,9788535917215,2010-02-15T13:19:02+00:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,Autores Portugueses,"As palavras de Saramago: catálogo de reflexões pessoais, literárias e políticas, elaborado a partir de declarações do autor recolhidas na imprensa escrita",2225
José Saramago,"O vencedor do prêmio Nobel José Saramago reconta episódios bíblicos do Velho Testamento sob o ponto de vista de Caim, que, depois de assassinar seu irmão, trava um incomum acordo com Deus e parte numa jornada que o levará do jardim do Éden aos mais recônditos confins da criação. Se, em O Evangelho segundo Jesus Cristo, José Saramago nos deu sua visão do Novo Testamento, neste Caimele se volta aos primeiros livros da Bíblia, do Éden ao dilúvio, imprimindo ao Antigo Testamento a música e o humor refinado que marcam sua obra. Num itinerário heterodoxo, Saramago percorre cidades decadentes e estábulos, palácios de tiranos e campos de batalha, conforme o leitor acompanha uma guerra secular, e de certo modo involuntária, entre criador e criatura. No trajeto, o leitor revisitará episódios bíblicos conhecidos, mas sob uma perspectiva inteiramente diferente. Para atravessar esse caminho árido, um deus às turras com a própria administração colocará Caim, assassino do irmão Abel e primogênito de Adão e Eva, num altivo jegue, e caberá à dupla encontrar o rumo entre as armadilhas do tempo que insistem em atraí-los. A Caim, que leva a marca do senhor na testa e portanto está protegido das iniquidades do homem, resta aceitar o destino amargo e compactuar com o criador, a quem não reserva o melhor dos julgamentos. Tal como o diabo de O Evangelho segundo Jesus Cristo, o deus que o leitor encontra aqui não é o habitual dos sermões: ao reinventar o Antigo Testamento, Saramago recria também seus principais protagonistas, dando a eles uma roupagem ao mesmo tempo complexa e irônica, cujo tom de farsa da narrativa só faz por acentuar. A volta aos temas religiosos serve, também, para destacar o que há de moderno e surpreendente na prosa de Saramago: aqui, a capacidade de tornar nova uma história que conhecemos de cabo a rabo, revelando com mordacidade o que se esconde nas frestas dessas antigas lendas. Munido de ferina veia humorística, Saramago narra uma estranha guerra entre o homem e o senhor. Mais que isso, investiga a fundo as possibilidades narrativas da Bíblia, demonstrando novamente que, ao recontar o mito e confrontar a tradição, o bom autor volta à superfície com uma história tão atual e relevante quanto se pode ser.

José Saramago,"As últimas páginas escritas por José Saramago em uma edição especial, acrescida de ensaios de Roberto Saviano, Fernando Gómez Aguilera e Luiz Eduardo Soares. Ao falecer, em junho de 2010, José Saramago havia deixado um último projeto inconcluso em seu computador. Sob o título de Alabardas, alabardas, espingardas, espingardas - um trecho retirado da obra Exortação da guerra, de Gil Vicente -, o prêmio Nobel português criava a história de Artur Paz Semedo, um homem comum que trabalha na fábrica de armas Produções Belona S. A. Paz Semedo é o funcionário exemplar que nunca questionou as ordens de seus superiores ou se angustiou com a finalidade dos artigos fabricados na empresa. Pelo contrário, sentia mesmo certo orgulho do renome da firma e ambicionava dirigir a área de armamentos pesados. Porém, sua mulher, Felícia, uma pacifista radical a ponto de alterar o seu primeiro nome, deixou-o por não suportar mais conviver com o ofício do marido. Há sinais por toda parte de que ele já não viverá com uma consciência tão tranquila. Nesta breve narrativa já se pode sentir toda a força e beleza típicas da obra de Saramago, que sem dúvida gestava ali um romance notável sobre a condição humana e a banalidade da violência.

José Saramago,"""Por muito incongruente que possa parecer..."", assim começa o novo romance - ou conto, como ele prefere chamá-lo - de José Saramago, sobre a insólita viagem de um elefante chamado Salomão, que no século XVI cruzou metade da Europa, de Lisboa a Viena, por extravagâncias de um rei e um arquiduque. O episódio é verdadeiro. Dom João III, rei de Portugal e Algarves, casado com dona Catarina d'Áustria, resolveu numa bela noite de 1551 oferecer ao arquiduque austríaco Maximiliano II, genro do imperador Carlos Quinto, nada menos que um elefante. O animal viera de Goa junto com seu tratador, algum tempo antes. De início, o exotismo de um paquiderme de três metros de altura e pesando quatro toneladas, bebendo diariamente duzentos litros de água e outros tantos quilos de forragem, deslumbrara os portugueses, mas agora Salomão não passava de um elefante fedorento e sujo, mantido num cercado nos arredores de Lisboa. Até que surge a idéia mirabolante de presenteá-lo ao arquiduque, então regente da Espanha e morando no palácio do sogro em Valladolid. Esse fato histórico é o ponto de partida para José Saramago criar, com sua prodigiosa imaginação, uma ficção em que se encontram pelos caminhos da Europa personagens reais de sangue azul, chefes de exército que quase chegam às vias de fato, padres que querem exorcizar Salomão ou lhe pedir um milagre. Depois de percorrer Portugal, Espanha e Itália, a caravana chega aos estreitos desfiladeiros dos Alpes, que Salomão enfrenta impávido. Com sua finíssima ironia e muito humor, sua prosa que destila poesia, Saramago reconstrói essa epopéia de fundo histórico e dela se vale para fazer considerações sobre a natureza humana e, também, elefantina. Impelido a cruzar meia Europa por conta dos caprichos de um rei e de um arquiduque, Salomão não decepcionou as cabeças coroadas.

EXCERTO  
A explosão reverberava ainda nos tímpanos de Artur, que sentiu o Buick abanar e o ar vibrar no momento do grande estrondo. Encolheu-se ao lado do automóvel e, ao abrir os olhos, apercebeu-se de uma enorme coluna de fumo negro que se erguia mesmo por cima dele. Pedaços de terra e asfalto e ainda pedrinhas começaram nessa altura a chover sobre a rua por entre uma densa nuvem de pó, obrigando-o a pôr as mãos em torno da cabeça para se proteger.  
Ouviram-se gritos e o som de pessoas a correr e, passada a surpresa inicial, o oficial descortinou Salazar de pé e imóvel junto à porta do carro, o fato negro coberto de poeira; dir-se-ia um espantalho plantado no passeio.  
«Senhor doutor!», gritou uma voz de homem, tão alterada que roçava o pânico. «Senhor doutor!»  
«Valha-me Deus! Virgem santíssima!», berrou uma mulher. «O que aconteceu? O que aconteceu?»  
«Vossa excelência está bem? Ficou ferido?» A desorientação parecia generalizada, apesar de os agentes da PVDE terem acorrido prontamente para se assegurarem de que o presidente do Conselho se encontrava bem e procurarem controlar a situação na rua, estabelecendo de imediato um perímetro de segurança. Também Artur se precipitou para ver como estava o ditador e, ao chegar ao passeio, deu com ele a sacudir a poeira dos ombros antes de sair da letargia e romper o mutismo.  
«Bem, vamos à missa.»

Narrativa de corte surrealista, belíssima parábola sobre o isolamento dos povos ibéricos em relação a seus irmãos europeus ao longo dos séculos. Racham os Pirineus, a Península Ibérica se desgarra da Europa. Transformada em ilha - Jangada de Pedra -, navega à deriva pelo oceano Atlântico. A esse espetacular acidente geológico somam-se outros insólitos que unem os quatro personagens principais do romance numa viagem apocalíptica e utópica pelos caminhos da linguagem e, por meio dela, pelos da arte e da cultura peninsulares. A história dos povos ibéricos, José Saramago a conta e reconta pela memória de um narrador, múltiplo de si mesmo e dos personagens cujas andanças acompanha. Os mitos se costuram nas pedras da fratura de que se fez a jangada. Neles se recuperam as crônicas, peregrinações de heróis anônimos ou notórios da identidade ibérica, todos notáveis, D. Quixote entre uns, os peregrinos de Santiago de Compostela na Idade Média entre outros. Narrativa perfeita na qual os fantasmas do inconsciente pousam familiarmente no cotidiano; surrealismo vigoroso que torna o incomum realidade, criando as condições oníricas para virar o mundo às avessas e, então, contar-lhe, com ironia e graça, os transtornos de erros e acertos, de enganos e desenganos. Posto assim ao contrário de si mesmo e de suas aparentes e reais firmezas, o mundo abre-se para a aventura ficcional da desconstrução das certezas das palavras e dos objetos; deixa-se viajar no estranhamento que daí decorre; reencontra-se em signos velhos e cristalizados: signos novos contudo, nos enigmas em que se tornam, reveladores também nas fantásticas soluções narrativas que desencadeiam.

O oficial do exército português estava nas trincheiras da Flandres, em plena carnificina da I Guerra Mundial, quando viu o seu amor testado pela mais dura das provas. Em segredo, o Alto Comando alemão preparava um ataque decisivo, uma ofensiva tão devastadora que lhe permitiria vencer a guerra num só golpe, e tencionava quebrar a linha de defesa dos aliados num pequeno sector do vale do Lys. O sítio onde estavam os portugueses. Tendo como pano de fundo o cenário trágico da participação de Portugal na Grande Guerra, A Filha do Capitão traz-nos a comovente história de uma paixão impossível e, num ritmo vivo e empolgante, assinala o regresso do grande romance às letras portuguesas. 
O Capitão Afonso Brandão mudou a sua vida quase sem o saber, numa fria noite de boleto, ao prender o olhar numa bela francesa de olhos verdes e voz de mel. O oficial comandava uma companhia da Brigada do Minho e estava havia apenas dois meses nas trincheiras da Flandres quando, durante o período de descanso, decidiu ir pernoitar a um castelo perto de Armentières. Conheceu aí uma deslumbrante baronesa e entre eles nasceu uma atracção irresistível. Mas o seu amor iria enfrentar um duro teste. O Alto Comando alemão, reunido em segredo em Mons, decidiu que chegara a hora de lançar a grande ofensiva para derrotar os aliados e ganhar a guerra, e escolheu o vale do Lys como palco do ataque final. À sua espera, ignorando o terrível cataclismo prestes a desabar sobre si, estava o Corpo Expedicionário Português.

José Régio (pseud.),"Era uma vez, no reino distante de Traslândia, um rei e uma rainha que não tinham filhos. Um dia, após a rainha se ter perdido num passeio pela floresta das fronteiras do reino, esta encontra o espírito da floresta que lhe promete um filho perfeito em todos os aspetos, exceto num: O príncipe terá orelhas de burro. 
Sei ao que vens — disse o gigantesco velho em voz grave e tom quase sarcástico. — O principezinho perfeito com orelhas de burro precisa de um preceptor em condições.  
Publicado pela primeira em 1942, esta obra de José Régio não é uma história infantil mas sim um romance de fantasia para adolescentes e adultos, repletas de analogias sobre questões filosóficas, sociais e até políticas – uma tendência literária que surgiu nos anos de 1940, um pouco por toda a Europa, de passar a incluir elementos de magia e fantasia em obras literárias dirigidas adultos e não apenas em histórias para crianças, muitas das vezes esmiuçando, reformulando ou decompondo velhos contos de fadas. Foi este tipo de gosto pela introdução do “imaginário fantástico” nas obras literárias consideradas “sérias”, que deu origem à chamada “Literatura Fantástica” nas décadas seguintes, iniciada por Tolkien; e depois ao “Realismo Mágico”, nascido na América do Sul, em que autores como Gabriel García Márquez ou Jorge Amado foram percursores. 
A história do “Príncipe com Orelhas de Burro” parte de um velho conto de fadas com o mesmo nome, que se encontra no folclore popular, um pouco por todo o mundo, mas que têm especial incidência na península ibérica pois é daí que provém a maior parte dos elementos que definem e compõe a história, tal como ela se conhece hoje.

José Milhazes,"A HISTÓRIA REAL DE VIDAS SACRIFICADAS ÀS PIORES UTOPIAS E TIRANIAS DO SÉCULO XXO destino cruel de pessoas que lutaram por uma sociedade melhor e acabaram vítimas dos dois piores sistemas totalitários do século xx.Em Os Blumthal, José Milhazes reconstitui as vidas dos avós de sua mulher, Siiri. Conta como os jovens idealistas Erich Sõerd e Leida Holm Blumthal participaram activamente na introdução da revolução comunista na sua Estónia natal, e depois foram ultrapassados pelos acontecimentos do mundo conturbado e muito violento do século XX e acabaram vítimas, primeiro do regime nazi, e depois do regime soviético.Só possível após uma grande investigação, que integrou a consulta de vários arquivos em vários países e de fontes histórias variadas – e de entrevistas à própria Siiri Milhazes –, esta obra revela a dramática saga familiar dos Blumthal e dos Sõerd em tempos de totalitarismo. Um livro actual e que não vai deixar ninguém indiferente, Os Blumthal é o novo livro de José Milhazes.

A partir de suas memórias de infância, o autor constrói neste romance o universo de um lugarejo quase parado no tempo, que subitamente se vê diante de um imenso mistério. Com grandes histórias e um elenco de personagens admiráveis, ele traça um retrato da vida rural portuguesa no início dos anos 1980, que vivia então um embate entre a tradição e a inevitável chegada da modernidade, em um momento economicamente difícil para o país.

Excerto  
""na terra do quintal. Empilhava tábuas que eram restos de madeira que o meu pai trazia da oficina e fazia casinhas. A cadela passava devagar, com os olhos castanhos perdidos no chão. Debaixo de uma laranjeira, meio enterrado, estava um pedaço comprido de arame enferrujado. Acredito que consigo lembrar-me do momento em que o meu corpo de quatro anos se levantou para, com as duas mãos, puxar o arame da terra. Vejo esse instante com a mesma falta de nitidez com que, agora, olho para o lado e distingo copas de árvores, misturas de folhas, a sucederem-se à minha passagem. Como uma imagem de cores líquidas a dissolverem-se umas sobre as outras. Naquele dia, voltei a sentar-me junto das tábuas empilhadas, que eram as casas que tinha construído. Segurava o arame e comecei a encontrar-lhe formas desajeitadas. Na minhas mãos, havia riscos de terra e ferrugem. Ouvi os movimentos da porta da rua a abrir-se. Era o meu irmão a sorrir. Tinha as roupas sujas de serradura porque era aprendiz do nosso pai e estava a voltar do trabalho. Disse-me qualquer cumprimento antes de reparar que eu tinha o arame na mão. Os canteiros que a minha mãe tratava com um sacho floriam atrás dele. O Simão tinha dez anos e era um rapaz. Às vezes, punha as mãos nos bolsos e ria-se. Quando me lembro dele nos dias que passaram antes daquele dia, a primeira imagem que me surge é ele de mãos nos bolsos, a rir-se. Naquela tarde, trazia a camisa fora das calças. Quando me viu com o arame na mão, deu três passos rápidos na minha direcção. A partir daqui, foi tudo rápido, mas agora, ao recordar-me, é tudo muito lento. As mãos do Simão eram maiores do que as minhas e tentavam tirar-me o arame. Não sei quais foram as palavras que escolheu para me dizer que não devia brincar com arames porque, antes de poder entendê-las, talvez por reflexo, talvez porque naquele momento me pareceu que devia ser assim, talvez porque achava que eu também sabia aquilo que devia fazer, talvez por nenhum motivo, por nenhum motivo, não larguei logo o arame. Continuei a segurá-lo com as duas mãos. Sentia a força do meu irmão no arame ferrugento que apertava com toda a força na palma das minhas mãos. E foi muito rápido, sei que foi um momento, mas agora parece-me que foi uma hora parada. Todos os movimentos divididos. Tudo muito devagar. A ponta do arame avançou na direcção da cara do meu irmão. Como se existisse uma linha recta a mostrar-lhe o caminho. A ponta enferrujada do arame avançou. O seu rosto. Num só movimento, a ponta do arame tocou-lhe na parte branca e húmida do olho direito, premiu-a ligeiramente e afundou-se definitiva num rasgão. O meu irmão largou o arame, afastou a cara e levou as duas mãos ao olho direito. Esse foi um momento de silêncio absoluto. Eu tinha quatro anos e sabia que tinha acontecido algo terrível. O meu irmão estava agarrado à cara e fazia sons de dor como eu nunca tinha ouvido. Não eram gritos. Eram sons de uma dor que o destruía devagar. Eu tinha quatro anos e segurava ainda o arame. Esse foi o momento em que a nossa mãe nos viu através do vidro da janela da cozinha. Esse momento terminou quando a nossa mãe saiu a correr pela porta, a perguntar: o que é que aconteceu?, o que é que aconteceu? Eu não conseguia dizer nada. O meu irmão segurava a cara e, atrás das suas mãos, nasciam fios de sangue que lhe escorriam pelo braço e pela face e pelo pescoço. Eram fios de sangue muito vivo que lhe desciam pelos pulsos, lhe atravessavam a pele lisa e clara do interior dos braços e lhe pingavam pelo bico do cotovelo. A nossa mãe, que não imaginava, aproximou-se dele, e disse-lhe: tem calma, tem calma. Sem imaginar, a tentar uma voz serena de mãe, disse-lhe: deixa lá ver o que é que aconteceu. O Simão, ainda a querer acreditar que podia haver uma possibilidade de não ter acontecido o que aconteceu, afastou as mãos lentamente. No seu rosto ensanguentado, eu e a minha mãe vimos a maneira como o lado direito da sua cara era um buraco de sangue onde estava a pele branca e vazia do olho, com o desenho circular e espalmado da íris, e que, entre o sangue, lhe escorria sobre o rosto a matéria espessa e viscosa, como a clara de um ovo, que estava antes no interior do olho. No lado esquerdo da cara do Simão, o outro olho, magoado e inocente, esperava a reacção da minha mãe. Eu tinha quatro anos e segurava ainda o arame. Larguei-o quando a minha mãe não conseguiu parar o grito amargurado que a rasgou. O meu irmão voltou a tapar o rosto. E as minhas irmãs entraram no quintal a correr pela porta da cozinha. E entraram vizinhos a correr pela porta da rua. A minha mãe gritava com toda a força da sua garganta. Alguém foi chamar o meu pai à oficina. Alguém me agarrou pela cintura, me levantou da terra do quintal e me levou para a cozinha. Entre os corpos das pessoas que amparavam a minha mãe, entre as minhas irmãs agarradas uma à outra a chorarem, entre as pessoas que rodeavam o meu irmão com toalhas limpas e, logo a seguir, encharcadas de sangue, eu tinha quatro anos e era devorado por um medo como lâminas. Estava em silêncio, parado, com os olhos abertos e muito grandes, a ser devorado por um medo como lâminas. Num momento, o meu pai entrou na cozinha. Ninguém poderia pará-lo. Apenas se ouvia a sua respiração. Passou entre as pessoas, segurou o meu irmão por um braço e, com os homens que estavam na cozinha a seguirem-nos, foram para o hospital. Quando saíram, era de noite. Assim que a porta bateu a fechar-se, ficou apenas a aflição da minha mãe e das minhas irmãs, seguida pelas vozes arrastadas das vizinhas que tentavam consolá-las. Foi uma dessas vizinhas que, entre as sombras das outras, riscou um fósforo e acendeu o candeeiro de petróleo sobre a mesa. A partir daí, enquanto o choro da minha mãe e das minhas irmãs ia enfraquecendo, as vizinhas iam-se despedindo e saindo. Ficámos sozinhos na cozinha: as pedras do chão da cozinha, a mesa e os bancos de madeira. Através da luz e das sombras do candeeiro de petróleo, a minha mãe e as minhas irmãs tinham os olhos abertos de encontro a uma imagem que só elas podiam ver. Passou um tempo frio de guinchos e de lâminas. Ao fim do serão, o meu pai e o Simão chegaram em silêncio. O meu irmão tinha o lado direito da cabeça envolto em ligaduras que lhe cobriam o olho. Ninguém disse nada. Fomos dormir. Essa noite foi como as noites de muitos meses que se seguiram. Havia um peso fundo dentro de nós a puxar-nos para o nosso interior mais negro. Passaram meses. O meu irmão""

""Ternura, morte e renovação - eis as notas que pautam o mais recente livro de José Luís Peixoto, um romance cheio de música e ritmos peculiares sentidos na pontuação e construção das frases; palavras que respiram, correm e desfalecem ao compasso da vivência das personagens, numa melodia que ora comove e revolta, ora nos faz sorrir e angustia (...) Não é um romance fatalista. É o ciclo redentor da vida escrito sem pudores. Muito bem escrito.""

José Luís Peixoto,"Em inusitada viagem à Coreia do Norte, o escritor José Luís Peixoto descobre as principais cidades e atrações do país em meio aos cânticos, estátuas e obeliscos do regime mais fechado do mundo. Em 2012, o governo norte-coreano realizou grandes celebrações pelo centenário do falecido ditador Kim Il-sung, pai do regime comunista que controla o país desde 1948. Nessa ocasião excepcional, um grupo de turistas ocidentais obteve autorização para viajar durante duas semanas num roteiro que incluiu a capital, Pyongyang, e diversos lugares raramente visitados por estrangeiros. A possibilidade de conhecer a vida cotidiana dos norte-coreanos estimulou uma antiga curiosidade do escritor português José Luís Peixoto. Radicalmente contrário a qualquer governo ditatorial, Peixoto mesmo assim embarcou na excursão, pomposamente batizada The Kim Il-sung 100th Birthday Ultimate Mega Tour, para ver e sentir de perto esse país banido do convívio internacional por sua insistência em fabricar armas nucleares. O resultado de suas experiências como turista na Coreia do Norte é este livro híbrido de relato de viagem e realismo mágico. Imerso no alucinatório culto à personalidade que domina todos os aspectos da cultura norte-coreana, Peixoto viajou pelo país sob a vigilância sorridente dos guias e dos retratos oficiais. Um clima de pesadelo orwelliano, que contrasta com o discurso triunfalista das autoridades, é o pano de fundo deste percurso fantástico pela distopia inventada por uma caricata dinastia de tiranos.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jose Luis Peixoto\Dentro do segredo_ Uma viagem pela (2259)\cover.jpg,9788543800318,2014-08-21T13:37:27+01:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,"Didático e Técnico, Political Ideologies, Communism; Post-Communism & Socialism, Travel, Politica, Autores Portugueses, Far East, Asia, Political Science",Dentro do segredo: Uma viagem pela Coreia do Norte,2259

Lisboa é a cidade onde ninguém dorme. Nem o narrador desta história surreal. A sua janela dá para a fachada de um edifício de apartamentos de cujos habitantes imagina a vida sexual (até se apaixonar por uma vizinha). 
Porém, quando começa a investigar a vida real dessas pessoas - e dessas mulheres -, percebe que a sua imaginação é demasiado pobre em comparação com a realidade; na «cidade que não dorme» o desejo confunde-se com a perdição, o delírio com a abjeção, e não há fronteiras entre sexos nem entre pessoas. Um romance erótico - e pornográfico, brutal, perigoso e inclassificável, onde reconhecemos parte da cidade e dos seus habitantes. Todos os lugares são reais; as personagens, às vezes - mas só às vezes -, são inventadas.

José Eduardo Agualusa,"Estreia de um dos mais aclamados escritores de língua portuguesa da atualidade na Companhia das Letras, Barroco tropical é um livro ambicioso, de grande fôlego e densidade. A ação se passa em Luanda no ano de 2020 e é narrada alternadamente pelo escritor Bartolomeu Falcato e pela cantora Kianda, sua amante. Os dois testemunham juntos um fato insólito, a queda de uma mulher - literalmente - do céu. A mulher em questão é uma modelo e ex-miss que frequentou a cama de políticos e empresários de expressão, o que a tornou uma figura incômoda para o establishment. Numa narrativa que avança e recua livremente no tempo e que se desloca entre a África, a Europa e o Brasil, Agualusa traça um retrato vivo e pulsante da sociedade angolana atual, onde as tradições ancestrais convivem de modo nem sempre pacífico com uma modernidade mal assimilada. Essas contradições estão sintetizadas no prédio onde mora o escritor Falcato, a Termiteira, futurística torre de sessenta andares, o maior edifício do continente, que não terminou de ser construído e já está em ruínas, abrigando os ricos nos andares superiores e a ralé social e criminal no subsolo. Mães de santo e curandeiros convivem nestas páginas com figurinistas de fama internacional, empresários da aviação, militares golpistas e traficantes de drogas e de armas. Romance generoso e exuberante, cheio de personagens pitorescos, Barroco tropical reflete desde o título o que Agualusa identificou em seu país como ""uma certa cultura do excesso, quer na maneira de as pessoas se divertirem, quer na maneira de demonstrarem o sentimento e a dor"". O insólito está sempre presente, mas intimamente entrelaçado ao prosaico e ao cotidiano, pois, como declarou o autor, referindo-se a Angola, Portugal e Brasil, ""nos nossos países a realidade tende a ser muito mais inverossímil do que a ficção"".",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jose Eduardo Agualusa\Barroco tropical (2271)\cover.jpg,9788535915693,2009-02-15T12:18:40+00:00,Companhia das Letras,4,,1.0,Romance,Barroco tropical,2271

José de Almada Negreiros,"O Manifesto Anti-Dantas e por extenso é um texto da autoria de José de Almada Negreiros, publicado em 1915 por ocasião da estreia da peça de teatro Soror Mariana Alcoforado de Júlio Dantas. 
Em 1915 foi publicado o segundo número da Revista Orpheu, marco inicial do Modernismo em Portugal, onde participaram nomes como Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro, Santa-Rita Pintor e Armando Côrtes-Rodrigues. Todavia, a sua novidade, o seu arrojo, a sua ousadia tanto na produção literária como pictórica, causou escândalo junto da burguesia lisboeta conservadora. Entre os muitos opositores ao movimento estava o médico e escritor Júlio Dantas, cuja crítica aos vanguardistas foi feroz. Através deste manifesto, Almada reagia publicamente, utilizando Júlio Dantas como símbolo das posições mais retrógradas. 
Almada escreve com veemência: ""BASTA PUM BASTA! UMA GERAÇÃO, QUE CONSENTE DEIXAR-SE REPRESENTAR POR UM DANTAS É UMA GERAÇÃO QUE NUNCA O FOI! É UM COIO D'INDIGENTES, D'INDIGNOS E DE CEGOS!

Jose Antonio Barreiros,"Em 1941, os ingleses temiam que Hitler, depois de subjugar a França, avançasse para a Península Ibérica. Receando essa invasão e desconfiando das intenções de Salazar, decidiram montar em Portugal uma rede clandestina que deveria destruir pontes, estradas e outras infra- estruturas para travar as tropas nazis. Com esta difícil missão, foi enviado para Lisboa um agente do SOE, o serviço de operações especiais britânico encarregue da «guerra não cavalheiresca». John Grosvenor Beevor instalou-se em Lisboa e recrutou os elementos desta rede constituída por ingleses e portugueses, entre os quais vários funcionários da empresa Shell e personalidades como o barão de Vilalva ou Cândido de Oliveira, mais tarde fundador do jornal A Bola. Mas quando Beevor decidiu convencer a Legião Portuguesa a alinhar nos seus planos, Salazar depressa reagiu. O ditador estava atento aos propósitos secretos de Londres.

Com este segundo volume, ""O Olho de Golem"", as expectativas confirmam-se. Dois anos passaram desde os últimos acontecimentos. Nathaniel tem agora catorze anos e é adjunto do Ministro da Administração Interna. O seu dever é desmantelar a Resistência, uma organização de comuns que quer derrubar o poder dos magos.

Entretanto, um jovem membro da Resistência, Kitty Jones, planeia roubar o túmulo sagrado do grande mago Gladstone. É então que, numa noite, os destinos de Nathaniel, Bartimaeus e Kitty se encontram sob os desígnios de algo bem mais poderoso… Alternando a focalização da acção entre Nathaniel e Kitty e com alguns capítulos contados na primeira pessoa por Bartimaeus – que confere a sua nota de sarcasmo e de humor irreverente à sempre crescente tensão – este novo volume guia-nos até Praga, faz-nos perseguir um esqueleto pelas ruas de Londres, testemunhar actos ousado e penetrar no mundo sórdido do governo dos magos.

Jonathan Franzen,"Liberdade, quarto romance do norte-americano Jonathan Franzen, foi um dos mais festejados lançamentos literários de 2010. Publicado nove anos após As correções (vencedor do National Book Award), o livro foi saudado como um painel amplo e profundo da sociedade americana contemporânea e um triunfo da prosa refinada que já fazia a fama do autor. A história de Liberdade gira ao redor de um trio de protagonistas. Walter e Patty Berglund formam, junto com os filhos adolescentes Joey e Jessica, uma típica família norte-americana liberal de classe média. Richard Katz é um roqueiro descolado que tenta fugir da fama que tanto buscava no passado. Os três se conhecem no final dos anos 1970, na Universidade de Minnesota, e a partir daí suas vidas se entrelaçam numa complexa relação de amizade, paixão, lealdade e traições que culminará com uma série de conflitos decisivos na primeira década do novo milênio, época em que o conceito de liberdade parece tão onipresente quanto fugidio. Como em As correções, Franzen mergulha numa tragédia familiar para dissecar, com incrível detalhe e personagens tão reconhecíveis quanto surpreendentes, a psique e os sonhos da classe média norte-americana, explorando temas como o choque entre as políticas liberais e conservadoras no contexto social e privado, os males da superpopulação e das ameaças ecológicas, a crise do politicamente correto e os dilemas afetivos de uma geração cada vez mais conectada, individualista e globalizada. Aclamado pela crítica, Liberdade também foi um fenômeno de mídia.

John Steinbeck,"Depois da América optimista de Walt Whitman - o grande bardo norte-americano do progresso e da democracia - optimismo que, na sua forma mais banalizada, se cristalizaria no conceito do *american way of life* , agravadas as condições de uma sociedade que parecia não conhecer limites para a sua prosperidade, sobrevindas as crises que culminaram no estoiro financeiro do final dos anos 20, a literatura digna desse nome tornou-se partícipe e testemunha das profundas transformações por que estava a passar a colectividade norte-americana. Com o grande «patrão» Theodor Dreiser a iluminar os caminhos da literatura social, a ficção que surge na década de 30 mostra uma decidida preferência pelo quotidiano, com os seus dramas, vicissitudes, lutas. É nesta conjuntura que se revela e afirma, desde logo como escritor de largo fôlego, John Steinbeck. Incomparável paisagista - a natureza é quase uma personagem na sua obra - Steinbeck explora o que há de trágico nessa fundamental contradição: no meio de uma natureza bela e generosa, ridente ou majestática, o homem, sacudido por interesses contrários, presa da miséria, da angústia, mas lutando pela sua emancipação. *Batalha Incerta* é um alto exemplo dessa incessante luta.

Publicado pela primeira vez em 1945 e inspirado pelos habitantes reais de Monterey, Bairro da Lata é um romance onde John Steinbeck recupera o cenário do seu primeiro grande êxito, O Milagre de São Francisco, escrevendo com um misto de humor e comoção sobre a aceitação da vida como ela é, no seu jogo entre um sentido de comunidade e a solidão da existência, entre a tragédia e a generosidade.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\John Steinbeck\Bairro da lata (2299)\cover.jpg,9789723829990,1968-02-15T12:18:24+00:00,Livros do Brasil,4,Cannery Row,1.0,"Colecção Dois Mundos, Romance, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros",Bairro da lata,2299
John Steinbeck,"As antigas crenças pagãs, as grandes epopeias gregas e os relatos da Bíblia servem de base a este romance extraordinário, que Steinbeck demorou cinco longos anos a escrever. Ao dar cumprimento àquele que sempre fora um dos grandes desejos do pai, criar uma quinta próspera na Califórnia, Joseph Wayne acaba por vir a acreditar que uma das mais belas árvores dessa quinta incorporou o espírito do seu progenitor. Os irmãos e respectivas famílias, que foram viver com ele, beneficiam dos êxitos e da prosperidade de Joseph, e a quinta vai-se de facto desenvolvendo – até um dos irmãos, assustado pelas suas crenças pagãs, decidir cortar a árvore, o que faz com que a doença e a fome se abatam de súbito sobre todos eles. A um Deus Desconhecido (1933) é um romance quase místico, que tem por tema central o modo como os homens tentam controlar as forças da natureza, e ao mesmo tempo compreender a sua relação com Deus e com o inconsciente.

John Steinbeck,"O clássico que valeu o Prêmio Pulitzer a John Steinbeck permanece como um dos arquétipos da cultura norte-americana. Agraciado também com o Nobel de Literatura, o autor retratou o homem moderno diante das dificuldades, a pobreza e a privação em um universo hostil, protagonizado por vítimas da competição e párias sociais. Este livro representa o confronto entre indivíduo e sociedade, através da epopéia da família Joad, expulsa pela seca dos campos de algodão de Oklahoma, para tentar a sobrevivência como bóias-frias nas plantações de frutas do Vale de Salinas, na Califórnia. Ao mesmo tempo que denuncia os dramas e flagelos de um país debilitado pela Grande Depressão dos anos 30, Steinbeck defende o conceito de que o indivíduo isolado nada vale, e a sobrevivência só é possível quando existe solidariedade entre os semelhantes.

Como es bien sabido, la obra pone en juego la historia paralela de una doble caída, la de Satán (a quien la ira divina precipitará a los abismos más alejados del Cielo, a las dolientes profundidades sobre las que el ángel caído reinará por toda la eternidad, herido en su orgullo y tramando una venganza sin fin) y la de Adán y Eva (que se verán expulsados del Paraíso terrenal y arrojados a la mortalidad, a un mundo habitado ya por la ruina, la finitud y el pecado).

O autor desenvolve a história da família Phelan, do patriarca, Troy Phelan, a seus estranhos herdeiros.

John Guy,"Duas rainhas, dois destinos interligados. Duas mulheres que mudaram o curso da História.  Rainha desde os doze dias e vivendo na corte francesa desde os cinco anos, Maria Stuart tinha dezasseis quando se tornou rainha de França, dezassete quando ficou viúva; e dezoito quando voltou à Escócia para desempenhar o seu papel de rainha numa terra conturbada. Fugindo às ideias preconcebidas sobre esta personagem, o autor através de um estudo minucioso retrata uma rainha astuta e consciente, que regressa à sua Escócia natal para reclamar o trono, sob o domínio da prima Isabel I de Inglaterra.  Maria, Rainha dos Escoceses, que nos é dada a conhecer ultrapassa a imagem de uma de mulher guerreira, perseguindo os inimigos com um elmo e espada em riste, mas de alguém que possuía uma grande habilidade política e inteligência, num mundo essencialmente masculino. Aos vinte e cinco anos ficou prisioneira de Isabel de quem só se libertaria se morresse. A vida de Maria Stuart é um drama e um conflito inigualáveis.

Ao longo dos tempos, estas irmandades de sangue têm vindo a tornar-se cada vez mais fortes, mais ricas e mais violentas do que nunca.

Apesar dessas diferenças intrigantes entre as organizações criminosas, as suas histórias fazem mais sentido quando entrecruzadas numa única narrativa, como revela John Dickie. As máfias partilham muito entre si, sobretudo uma relação perversa com o Estado italiano, que seduzem e combatem alternadamente, num processo de infiltração já muito antigo.

Se durasse uma semana poderia provocar o colapso da nossa civilização. Uma catástrofe destas não só é possível, como assustadoramente provável, porque a Internet assenta num sistema tecnológico tão complexo como frágil. E basta um erro humano para perdermos o controlo das comunicações digitais.

Joël Dicker,"Depois d'A Verdade, O Desaparecimento.  Apenas Joël Dicker poderia superar-se a si mesmo, com o thriller mais poderoso dos últimos anos, uma obra que não dá tréguas, tão sofisticada e viciante quanto A verdade sobre o caso Harry Quebert. Na noite de 30 de Julho de 1994, a pacata vila de Orphea, na costa leste dos Estados Unidos, assiste ao grande espectáculo de abertura do festival de teatro. Mas o presidente da Câmara está atrasado para a cerimónia# Ao mesmo tempo, Samuel Paladin percorre as ruas desertas da vila à procura da mulher, que saiu para correr e não voltou. Só pára quando encontra o seu corpo em frente à casa do presidente da Câmara. Dentro da casa, toda a família do presidente está morta. A investigação é entregue a Jesse Rosenberg e Derek Scott, dois jovens polícias do estado de Nova Iorque. Ambiciosos e tenazes, conseguem cercar o assassino e são condecorados por isso. Vinte anos mais tarde, na cerimónia de despedida de Rosenberg da Polícia, a jornalista Stephanie Mailer confronta-o com uma revelação inesperada: o assassino não é quem eles pensavam, e a jornalista reclama ter informações-chave para encontrar o verdadeiro culpado. Dias depois, Stephanie desaparece. Assim começa este thriller colossal, de ritmo vertiginoso, entrelaçando tramas, personagens, surpresas e volte-faces, sacudindo o leitor e impelindo-o, sem possibilidade de parar, até ao inesperado e inesquecível desenlace. O que aconteceu a Stephanie Mailer? E o que aconteceu realmente no Verão de 1994? Os elogios da crítica:«Como é o novo Dicker? Podemos responder, sem hesitação: extraordinário!»Le Point «Stephanie Mailer, tal como Harry Quebert antes dela, mantém-nos agarrados. Felizmente, escrever não é meramente #juntar palavras que formam frases#. Escrever também é construir, e nisso Dicker é excelente.»La Liberté «Cinco temporadas de uma série de televisão viciante num só livro. O desaparecimento de Stephanie Mailer mostra em pleno o talento do escritor: uma teia de intrigas que mantém o leitor preso por um fio.»Le Temps «O autor redescobre a sua força sedutora: a combinação de eficácia visual à americana com a elegância do detalhe à europeia.»24 Heures «Dicker não larga a mão do leitor que, apesar da variedade de personagens, da avalanche de pistas falsas, nunca perde o fio à meada. A cada cinquenta páginas, o leitor pensa ter encontrado o verdadeiro assassino. Mas para isso terá de esperar: o autor é muito hábil e diverte-se como um louco a induzir o leitor em erro.»Le Figaro Littéraire «Romance após romance, Joël Dicker impõe-se como um mestre de ilusionismo.»Elle «Preciso, denso, dinâmico, rápido, divertido, atravessado por uma ironia refrescante. Mas a sua maior qualidade, e a sua evolução em relação aos livros anteriores, é que esta complexidade, esta rapidez de acção, não impede o romance de ser comovente e poético ao mesmo tempo. É um livro com alma.»Matin Dimanche «Enquanto Agatha Christie punha em cena 'apenas' dez suspeitos, Joël Dicker joga com dezenas de personagens a um ritmo inacreditável. De tirar o fôlego!»Madame Figaro «Conhece aquele sentimento terrível de se sentir sozinho depois de acabar um romance incrível? Foi o que me aconteceu com este livro.

Para os acalmar, o investidor que ali pretende fazer um centro comercial contrata Ross Wakeman, um investigador do paranormal. Ross tentou o suicídio por diversas vezes, na esperança de se ir juntar a Aimee, a noiva que morrera oito anos antes. Mas após diversas noites a investigar, tudo o que Ross encontra é Lia Beaumont, uma mulher misteriosa que, tal como Ross, pretende desafiar as fronteiras que separam a vida da morte. Assim tem início uma extraordinária história de amor e de destino, marcada por um crime passional.

Jodi Picoult,"Daniel Stone era o único rapaz branco da vila esquimó do Alasca onde a mãe dava aulas. Por ser diferente, todos troçavam dele sem misericórdia e ele retribuiu tornando--se o pior dos adolescentes, roubando, bebendo e assaltando, até um dia deixar a vila. Quinze anos depois, Daniel é uma pessoa totalmente diferente: um pai calmo e atencioso, autor de banda desenhada, casado com uma professora que dá aulas sobre Dante e o seu Inferno. Trixie, a filha de ambos, é tudo para Daniel. 
Mas toda esta calma é perturbada no dia em que Trixie é violada numa festa e Daniel começa a debater-se novamente com uma impotência e uma raiva que podem destruí- lo a si e à sua família. 
O Décimo Círculo questiona até onde somos capazes de ir por alguém que amamos e quantas vezes somos capazes de nos reinventar até os nossos erros desaparecerem para sempre ou voltarem para nos assombrar quando menos esperamos. 
Mas este livro mostra que existe mais do que uma maneira de contar uma história. No livro encontramos também a banda desenhada de Daniel Stone que conta a história de uma rapariga que é raptada pelo diabo e levada para o inferno de Dante, e do pai que literalmente desce ao inferno para salvá-la. 
Este livro viaja desde os corredores de um liceu moderno até uma vila isolada no Alasca, e do inferno até ao coração desfeito de um pai.

Jodi Picoult,"Quando um lobo sabe que o seu tempo está a terminar e que já não é útil à sua alcateia, muitas vezes escolhe afastar-se. Morre assim afastado da sua família, do seu grupo, mantendo até ao fim todo o orgulho que lhe é próprio e mantendo-se fiel à sua natureza.  
Luke Warren passou a vida inteira a estudar lobos. Chegou inclusivamente a viver com lobos durante longos períodos. Em muitos sentidos, Luke compreende melhor as dinâmicas da alcateia do que as da sua própria família. A mulher, Georgie, desistiu finalmente da solidão em que viviam e deixou-o. O filho, Edward, de vinte e quatro anos, fugiu há seis, deixando para trás uma relação destroçada com o pai. Recebe então um telefonema alarmante: Luke ficou gravemente ferido num acidente de automóvel com Cara, a irmã mais nova de Edward.   
De repente, tudo muda: Edward tem de regressar a casa e enfrentar o pai que deixou aos dezoito anos. Ele e Cara têm de decidir juntos o destino do pai. Não há respostas fáceis, e as perguntas são muitas: que segredos esconderam Edward e Cara um do outro? Haverá razões ocultas para deixarem o pai morrer… ou viver? Qual seria a vontade de Luke? Como podem os filhos tomar uma decisão destas num contexto de culpa, sofrimento, ou ambos? E, sobretudo, terão esquecido aquilo que todo e qualquer lobo sabe e nunca esquece: cada membro da alcateia precisa dos outros, e às vezes a sobrevivência implica sacrifício.  
Lobo Solitário descreve de forma brilhante a dinâmica familiar: o amor, a proteção, a força que podem dar, mas também o preço a pagar por ela.

João Tordo,"""Numa pequena ilha perdida no Atlântico, um homem procura a solidão e o esquecimento, mas acaba por encontrar muito mais. A ilha alberga criaturas singulares: um padre sonhador, de nome Elias Gro; uma menina de onze anos perita em anatomia; Alma, uma senhora com um coração maior do que a ilha; Norbert, um velho louco que tem por hábito vaguear na noite; e o fantasma de um escritor, cuja casa foi engolida pelo mar. O narrador, lacerado pelo passado, luta com os seus demónios no local que escolheu para se isolar: um farol abandonado, à mercê dos caprichos da natureza -- e dos outros habitantes da ilha. Com o vagar com que mudam as estações, o homem vai, passo a passo, emergindo do seu esconderijo, fazendo o seu luto, e descobrindo, numa travessia de alegria e dor, a medida certa do amor. O luto de Elias Gro é o romance mais atmosférico e intimista de João Tordo, um mergulho na alma humana, no que ela tem de mais obscuro e luminoso.""--Back cover.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Joao Tordo\O luto de Elias Gro (2328)\cover.jpg,9789898775337,2015-02-15T13:05:43+00:00,Companhia das Letras,4,Trilogia dos Lugares Sem Nome,1.0,Romance,O luto de Elias Gro,2328

João Tordo,"Autor vencedor do Prémio Literário José Saramago.  O deslumbre de Cecilia Fluss marca o fim da trilogia composta pelos romances O luto de Elias Gro e O paraíso Segundo Lars D.  «Com as incógnitas eu consigo viver, são os factos que eu não aguento.» Aos catorze anos, Matias Fluss é um adolescente preocupado com três coisas: o sexo, um tio enlouquecido e as fábulas budistas. Vive com a mãe e a irmã mais velha, Cecilia, numa espécie de ninho onde lambe as feridas da juventude: a primeira paixão, as dúvidas existenciais, os conflitos de afirmação. Sempre que sente o copo a transbordar, refugia-se na cabana isolada do tio Elias. Cedo, contudo, a inocência lhe será arrancada com o desaparecimento súbito de Cecilia, que, afundada numa paixão por um homem desconhecido, é vista pela última vez a saltar de uma ponte. Muito mais tarde, Matias será obrigado a revisitar a dor, quando a sua pacata vida de professor universitário for interrompida por uma carta vinda das sombras do passado, lançando a suspeita sobre o que aconteceu realmente à irmã - sem saber ainda que regressar ao passado poderá significar, também, resgatar-se a si mesmo.

João Tordo,"Quando o narrador, um escritor prematuramente frustrado e hipocondríaco, viaja até Budapeste para um encontro literário, está longe de imaginar até onde a literatura o pode levar. Coxo, portador de uma bengala, e planeando uma viagem rápida e sem contratempos, acaba por conhecer Vincenzo Gentile, um escritor italiano mais jovem, mais enérgico, e muito pouco sensato, que o convence a ir da Hungria até Itália, onde um famoso produtor de cinema tem uma casa de província no meio de um bosque, escondida de olhares curiosos, e onde passa a temporada de Verão à qual chama, enigmaticamente, de O Bom Inverno. O produtor, Don Metzger, tem duas obsessões: cinema e balões de ar quente. Entre personagens inusitadas, estranhos acontecimentos, e um corpo que o atraiçoa constantemente, o narrador apercebe-se que em casa de Metzger as coisas não são bem o que parecem. Depois de uma noite agitada, aquilo que podia parecer uma comédia transforma-se em tragédia: Metzger é encontrado morto no seu próprio lago. Porém, cada um dos doze presentes tem uma versão diferente dos acontecimentos. Andrés Bosco, um catalão enorme e ameaçador, que constrói os balões de ar quente de Metzger, toma nas suas mãos a tarefa de descobrir o culpado e isola os presentes na casa do bosque. Assustadas, frágeis, e egoístas, as personagens começam a desabar, atraiçoando-se e acusando-se mutuamente, sob a influência do carismático e perigoso Bosco, que desaparece para o interior do bosque, dando início a um cerco.

Os segredos por revelar de todas estas personagens perpassam num romance cheio de enigmas e vozes e criam uma atmosfera de suspense e claustrofobia que faz de cada página um passo expectante na direcção de uma escuridão cada vez maior, de um desenlace ao mesmo tempo macabro e romântico.Com ecos de Kafka e de Auster e influências do novo conto gótico, O Livro dos Homens sem Luz revisita os clássicos da literatura de mistério - de Wilkie Collins a Edgar Allan Poe -, oferecendo-lhes um espaço peculiar no qual o autor entrega o destino das personagens a si próprias.

João Tordo,"Uma narrativa vertiginosa sobre a identidade e a memória inspirada em grandes clássicos da literatura e na própria vida do autor. Livro recomendado pelo Plano Nacional de Leitura O que significa ser único? Qual é a marca da nossa identidade? Após anos de vida desregrada no Quebeque, Hugo, um contrabaixista em crise de inspiração, regressa a Lisboa. Vê o regresso como um ano sabático, em que encontrará consolo junto da família e poderá talvez terminar, por fim, uma melodia que não lhe sai da cabeça. Numa noite em Lisboa, assiste a um concerto de Luís Stockman. Nessa precisa noite, a esperança de encontrar o equilíbrio cai por terra. O pianista no palco é igual a si - no rosto, nos gestos. E nessa noite estreia ao piano um tema que Hugo conhece muito bem: é a melodia que anda há anos a tentar escrever. A semelhança entre os dois músicos é tal que, de um momento para o outro, começam a confundi-lo com o pianista, e a sua própria mãe lança a dúvida. Quem é ele, afinal, se há um outro igual a si, o espelho invertido do seu fracasso? Hugo mergulha num labirinto de memórias e contradições, procurando o seu duplo, perseguindo a verdade, tão fugidia quanto o que julgava ser a sua essência. É a um amigo do pianista, narrador do livro, que cabe desmontar os acontecimentos e repor a verdade sobre as vidas dos dois músicos, sobrepostas como num espelho. Inspirando-se numa história verdadeira - a sua própria - e em clássicos como O Duplo de Dostoiévski, O Retrato de Dorian Gray ou mesmo O Homem Duplicado, de José Saramago, João Tordo constrói uma narrativa vertiginosa, onde a verdade escapa ao leitor a cada página.

Por desonrar o nome da família, o jovem Katsuro é exilado pelo seu próprio pai, um poderoso governador, num ilhéu inóspito. Abandonado, o rapaz irá deparar-se com o terrível segredo da família Tsukuda, enquanto luta para sobreviver à fome, à sede e à culpa. Lisboa, cem anos depois.

João Tordo,"«Toda a capacidade que existe no melhor de José Saramago ao surpreender no desenrolar a tela onde pinta os seus romances com soluções inimagináveis.»João Céu e Silva, Diário de Notícias Numa estrada adormecida da Galiza, dois homens atropelam um javali. A visão do animal morto na estrada levará um deles - Saldaña Paris, um jovem poeta mexicano de olhos azuis inquietos - a puxar o primeiro fio do novelo da sua vida. Instigado pelas confissões desconjuntadas do poeta, o seu companheiro de viagem - um professor universitário divorciado - irá tentar descobrir o que está por trás da persistente melancolia de Saldaña Paris. A viagem de descoberta começa com a leitura de um manuscrito da autoria da ex-mulher do mexicano, Teresa, que morreu há pouco tempo e marcou a vida do poeta como um ferro em brasa. O narrador não poderia adivinhar (porque nunca podemos saber as verdadeiras consequências dos nossos actos) que a leitura desse manuscrito teria o mesmo efeito sobre a sua vida. As páginas escritas por Teresa revelam a sua adolescência no seio de uma família portuguesa contaminada pela desilusão: um pai ausente e alcoólico, um tio aventureiro e misterioso, uma mãe demasiado protectora. Mas o que ressalta com maior vivacidade daquelas páginas é o relato enternecedor do seu primeiro amor, ao mesmo tempo que começam a insinuar-se na sua vida realidades grotescas e brutais. Confrontado pela primeira vez com a suspeita dessa terrível possibilidade, Saldaña Paris mergulha numa depressão profunda. Determinado em libertar o amigo do poder corrosivo do mal, o nosso narrador compõe então, peça a peça, a biografia involuntária dos dois amantes. Uma biografia que passa pelo desvelar do passado, para que este não contamine irremediavelmente o futuro. Nesta dupla tentativa de salvação (a do amigo mas também a sua própria), o professor irá procurar encontrar «as coisas certas» queainda nos definem como humanos e resgatar a possibilidade de um futuro com dias felizes.

João Tordo,"Um jornalista português insensato e ambicioso quer provar para seu editor - um comunista irascível, alcoólico e com bastante desprezo pelos jovens - que não é só mais um na redação. Escolhido para ir a Berlim entrevistar o biógrafo de um mártir religioso, aproveita a deixa para fazer, em seu artigo, uma analogia com a história de Catarina Eufémia, a camponesa que se tornou um ícone do Partido Comunista, mas de quem, na verdade, pouco ou nada sabe. Quando, porém, o artigo é publicado, as reações de indignação por parte dos leitores não se fazem esperar, algumas das quais bastante ameaçadoras; e, na noite em que o editor é encontrado na rua em coma, aparentemente brutalizado, o jornalista se pergunta se não foi por defender publicamente seu artigo e começa suspeitando de que existe muito mais em jogo do que a simples memória de uma camponesa assassinada durante a ditadura. É então que decide investigar obsessivamente a vida de Catarina, desbravando por entre o nevoeiro que paira sobre os mártires e os transforma em mitos de que sempre alguém se apodera.

João Tordo,"14 de Setembro de 1998. O dia em que Chatlam, uma pequena vila americana, acordou em choque com o homicídio de Noah Walsh. O principal suspeito: a sua filha de dezasseis anos. No Verão de 1987, o adolescente Pedro Taborda apaixona-se por Laura Walsh, a filha mais velha de um magnata nova-iorquino. Ela e Levi – uma criança misteriosa – passam férias com os pais no Lagoeiro, uma pacata cidade algarvia. Rica e moderna, a família Walsh tem tudo para dar muito nas vistas no sul de Portugal. Inebriado pelas formas perfeitas e pelos modos ousados de Laura, Pedro encontra na rapariga americana o seu primeiro amor. Mas quando o Verão acaba, a família Walsh regressa aos Estados Unidos e o destino fica por cumprir. 
Dez anos depois, Pedro, decidido a tornar-se escritor, vai estudar para Nova-Iorque. Fascinado com Gary List, antigo prodígio das letras americanas, chega aos Estados Unidos determinado a perseguir os sonhos da juventude. Ao reencontrar Laura, está longe de suspeitar que esse acaso o mergulhará no crime mais falado dos anos noventa, o homicídio do milionário Noah Walsh. 
Com um segundo homicídio a atrapalhar a investigação e uma corrida para salvar Levi, de apenas dezasseis anos, acusada de matar o pai, Pedro e Laura enredam-se irremediavelmente na teia de segredos que envolve a família Walsh, desde os anos quarenta do século XX até ao impensável desfecho nas primeiras décadas do novo milénio. 
Porque em Chatlam – e neste thriller imparável – nada é o que parece.

João Tordo,"Que segredos rodeiam a vida de António Augusto Millhouse Pascal, um velho senhor que se esconde do mundo num casarão de província, acompanhado de três netos insolentes, um jardineiro soturno e um rol de clientes tão abastados e influentes como perigosos e loucos? São estes mistérios que o narrador - um rapaz de família modesta - procurará desvendar durante mais de um quarto de século, não podendo adivinhar que o emprego que lhe é oferecido por aquela estranha personagem se irá transformar numa obsessão que acabará por consumir a sua própria vida. Passando pelo Alentejo, por Lisboa e por Nova Iorque em plenos anos oitenta - época de todas as ganâncias - e cruzando a história sangrenta do século XX com a das personagens, As Três Vidas é, simultaneamente, uma viagem de autodescoberta através do «outro» e a história da paixão do narrador por Camila, a neta mais velha de Millhouse Pascal, e do destino secreto que a aguarda; que estará, tal como o do avô, inexoravelmente ligado à sorte de um mundo que ameaça, a qualquer momento, resvalar da corda bamba em que se sustém.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Joao Tordo\As Tres Vidas (2338)\cover.jpg,9789722049559,2012-04-24T14:47:17+01:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Romance, Autores Portugueses, General",As Três Vidas,2338

Ou do seu filho António, que fez duas comissões em África e conheceu a madrinha de guerra numa livraria. Ou mesmo do neto, Duarte, que um dia andou de bicicleta todo nu. Através de episódios aparentemente autónomos - e tendo como ponto de partida a Revolução de 1974 -, este romance constrói a história de uma família marcada pelos longos anos de ditadura, pela repressão política, pela guerra colonial. Duarte, cuja infância se desenrola já sob os auspícios de Abril, cresce envolto nessas memórias alheias - muitas vezes traumáticas, muitas vezes obscuras - que formam uma espécie de trama onde um qualquer segredo se esconde. Dotado de enorme talento, pianista precoce e prodigioso, afigura-se como o elemento capaz de suscitar todas as esperanças.

João Nunes,"""Como Escrever um Argumento de Cinema"" é uma introdução à escrita para cinema, televisão e audiovisual em geral. Tem uma ideia que gostaria de ver transformada num filme? O primeiro passo é escrever o argumento desse filme, também chamado de guião ou roteiro de cinema. Mas para isso precisa ter as noções básicas de dramaturgia, desenvolvimento de tramas narrativas, criação de personagens e escrita de cenas e diálogos. ""Como Escrever um Argumento de Cinema"" é uma primeira abordagem a todos estes temas, leve e fácil de entender, escrita por um argumentista profissional com mais de 3500 páginas de roteiros produzidas em seis longas-metragens, vários telefilmes e dezenas de episódios de séries televisivas. ""Como Escrever um Argumento de Cinema"" começa com um Plano de Trabalho que, se respeitado, lhe permitirá chegar ao fim do seu guião em apenas 30 dias. Inclui ainda as dicas mais importantes para abordar os desafios da escrita do roteiro, e termina com uma abordagem ao processo de reescrita que sempre deve existir antes da apresentação pública de um argumento de cinema. O essencial deste pequeno mas bem recheado livro nasceu da interação do autor, João Nunes, com os leitores do seu blogue https://joaonunes.com, onde há mais de quinze anos publica sobre temas relacionados com a escrita audiovisual e o cinema. ========== Alguns comentários ao blogue: ✓ ""Olá João, muito obrigado por compartilhar seus conhecimentos connosco.

E quando uma lei atribui mais dinheiro aos hospitais psiquiátricos do que aos orfanatos, a situação de Elodie piora dramaticamente.

O orfanato transforma-se num hospital onde as crianças são submetidas a tratamentos para doenças que não têm, as janelas estão cobertas por grades e as aulas são substituídas por trabalho pesado.

Joana Bértholo,"Neste livro, a cada um dos 18 temas do álbum de música eletrónica Um Argentino no Deserto, de René Bertholo, corresponde um conto. Os contos começam quando o pintor começa, em 1935, e seguem uma cronologia que se aproxima e afasta da vida dele, das pessoas em torno dele, das obras que criou, das obras que o marcaram, e dos momentos coletivos que a sua história individual intercetou. Os contos acabam quando o pintor acaba, e a música para de tocar, mas o legado do que nos deixou, perdura. Perdura também a memória do seu brincar, nas narrativas dos amigos próximos com quem a autora conversou. É isso, arte e amizade, o que continuará a dar origem a outras coisas. Este livro é uma dessas outras coisas.“Um Argentino no Deserto é o tipo de música com que Russolo e os outros futuristas sonharam, nos seus manifestos, mas que nunca realizaram/concretizaram verdadeiramente.” Brian Lavelle, Vital WeeklyEm 1982, quando René retorna a Portugal, está Joana bastante atarefada com o ofício de vir ao mundo.

Jo Nesbø,"Noite escura. Lá fora começa a nevar. A primeira neve do ano. No conforto da sua casa, Jonas acorda a meio da noite, chama pela mãe, mas o único rasto que encontra são as pegadas húmidas no chão das escadas. No jardim, a mesma figura solitária que vira durante o dia: o boneco de neve, agora banhado pelo luar, com os olhos negros fixos na janela do quarto. E no pescoço um agasalho: o cachecol cor de rosa que oferecera à mãe. Encarregado da investigação, o Inspetor Harry Hole está convencido de que existe uma ligação entre o estranho desaparecimento da mãe de Jonas e uma carta ameaçadora que recebeu alguns meses antes. Quando Harry e a sua equipa começam a analisar antigos casos por resolver, descobrem que, ao longo dos anos, no primeiro dia em que nevou, desapareceu um número alarmante de mulheres, com uma característica comum: eram todas casadas com filhos. E quando se vê confrontado com outro caso com as mesmas características, as suspeitas de Harry confirmam-se: não passa de um mero peão num jogo mortífero. Pela frente tem o primeiro assassino em série da Noruega, um assassino tão inteligente, que quase o leva à loucura.

Jo Nesbø,"A sombria tragédia escrita pelo dramaturgo mais influente do mundo recontada por um dos maiores autores de thrillers policiais da atualidade. Em uma cidade industrial cinzenta e chuvosa na década de 1970, a polícia concentra todos os seus esforços em acabar com o tráfico de drogas e a violência, bem como a criminalidade que decorre disso. Duncan, o novo comissário-chefe, é um idealista e um visionário, a favor de uma gestão transparente e engajado na luta contra qualquer forma de corrupção. Ele é um sonho para a população. E um pesadelo para os criminosos. A missão da polícia não é nada simples. O mercado de drogas da cidade é comandado por dois homens – Sweno, líder de uma perigosa gangue, e Hécate, um mestre da manipulação, que tem ligações com as esferas mais elevadas do poder. Mas Duncan tem uma poderosa arma: Macbeth, o chefe do Grupo de Operações Especiais, um homem do povo. E também uma pessoa ambiciosa, influenciável e com tendências paranoicas e violentas.

Jeremy Dronfield,"«Há muitas histórias do Holocausto, mas não como esta. A história de Gustav e de Fritz Kleinmann, pai e filho, contém elementos de todas as outras, mas é muito diferente de qualquer outra.»Viena, anos de 1930.A família Kleinmann vive um dia-a-dia pacato e tranquilo. Gustav trabalha como estofador e Tini trata da casa e dos quatro filhos: Fritz, Edith, Herta e Kurt. Mas, com a anexação nazi da Áustria, a normalidade da vida dos Kleinmann dissipa-se abrupta e dramaticamente. Os vizinhos viram-se contra eles, o negócio de Gustav é-lhe retirado e a ameaça paira sobre toda a família de forma cada vez mais alarmante. Gustav (pai) e Fritz (filho) são dos primeiros judeus austríacos a ser presos. Destino: Buchenwald, na Alemanha. Assim começou uma inimaginável provação – várias vezes torturados, quase mortos à fome e brutalmente forçados a construir o próprio campo de concentração em que estão detidos. Ao longo dos horrores que testemunharam e do sofrimento por que passaram, uma constante ajudou a mantê-los vivos: o amor entre pai e filho.  Quando Gustav recebeu ordem de transferência para Auschwitz, uma sentença de morte certa, Fritz viu-se perante um dilema: deixar o pai morrer sozinho ou ir com ele...  Baseado no diário secreto de Gustav e numa meticulosa pesquisa documental, este livro conta a sua história, e a de Fritz, pela primeira vez – uma história única e absolutamente incrível de coragem, amor e sobrevivência face ao terror sem paralelo que foi o Holocausto.   O Rapaz Que Seguiu o Pai para Auschwitz confronta-nos com o pior e o melhor da humanidade.

D. Maria encarna fielmente as contradições desse tempo, pois, apesar do seu conservadorismo religioso, soube compreender, pelo menos em alguns aspetos, o Iluminismo, adotando uma abordagem humanitária dos assuntos de Estado. Desde o seu tão aguardado nascimento em Lisboa, então a cidade mais opulenta da Europa, até à sua morte, num ambiente austero no Brasil, esta biografia lê-se como um romance histórico. A autora revisita a história política da época, as complexidades da vida privada da rainha, os principais acontecimentos e a vida das personalidades desse período histórico. D. Maria I - a Vida Notável de Uma Rainha oferece aos seus leitores uma visão íntima do mundo das monarquias absolutas, da vida quotidiana na corte portuguesa e na velha Europa, antes da Revolução Francesa e da ascensão de Napoleão que levou a dinastia de Bragança à beira da ruína.

Erin Granger, uma arqueóloga brilhante mas desencantada - é enviado para explorar aquela descoberta macabra, um templo subterrâneo que encerra o cadáver crucificado de uma rapariga mumificada.

O inimigo que os persegue é ímpar, uma força do mal muito antiga controlada por um líder de ambições e astúcia incalculáveis.   
Entre sepulturas delapidadas e igrejas magníficas, Erin e os dois companheiros terão de enfrentar um passado que remonta a milhares de anos, a um tempo em que criaturas demoníacas percorriam os cantos mais negros do mundo, ao momento em que Jesus fez uma oferta milagrosa, um pacto de salvação com aqueles que estavam condenados à eternidade.

Não era um iniciado nestas sombrias artes. Muito pelo contrário, já o tinha feito centenas de vezes. Soneji não pretende um simples resgate para os poderosos pais reaverem os seus filhos, ele pretende muito mais, um lugar que só os grandes alcançam: um marco na história, a sua vida contada em livro, pela mão de Alex Cross. Alex Cross é detective de polícia em Washington, D.C., psicólogo especialista em estabelecer perfis de criminosos e aclamado autor de bestsellers policiais. A sua fama precede-o, mas à medida que o tempo passa e que cada caso é resolvido, sente-se mais e mais cansado da desgastante tarefa de entrar na cabeça de cada criminoso que encontra no seu caminho.  
Especialmente depois da morte do seu parceiro. Nunca se teria envolvido na resolução de um caso federal, não fosse uma prova evidente do rapto ter sido deixada propositadamente na sua caixa do correio. Soneji conseguiu o seu primeiro objectivo, tal como a aranha que meticulosamente caminha na sua teia à volta da presa que por ela foi atraída: Alex Cross, o grande escritor, estava agora formalmente a trabalhar no caso dos raptos. Juntamente com Jezzie Flannigan, responsável pelo corpo dos Serviços Secretos que deviam proteger e vigiar o colégio, vão formar uma equipa na tentativa de trazer o raptor à tribuna da justiça. Mas Soneji tem planos diferentes. Uma das crianças aparece finalmente... mas morta. Depois de superado o caos inicial do choque de não estarem a lidar com um vulgar raptor, Cross, finalmente entende o que Soneji pretende: ser conhecido como o maior criminoso na história que nunca foi apanhado, superando o caso do homicídio de Charles Lindbergh Jr. que nunca foi solucionado e que lhe serviu de inspiração. Agora é continuar com o plano: perpetuar o verdadeiro «crime do século» e fazer com que Cross o documente e publique. Será Gary Soneji vítima de um grave distúrbio psicológico ou um manipulador brilhante com soberbos dotes dramáticos? Um thriller psicológico complexo, esmagador e profundamente intrigante, inspirador de um medo genuíno que nos mantém suspensos sobre o abismo do assombro e do terror.

Mehmed-Paxá, Grão-vizir, sonha ainda com o dia em que, criança, foi separado da sua família cristã, obrigado a atravessar para a outra margem do rio. É essa criança que agora, décadas depois, convertido à fé do Islão, dá a ordem de construção de uma ponte sobre o rio Drina. Esta é a história épica dessa ponte, e também a dos seus habitantes. A sua edificação exigiu anos de trabalho árduo, lágrimas e sangue, sacrifícios e vítimas. Ao longo dos séculos a ponte foi local de passagem, de encontros, de conversas, de conspirações; sofreu inundações, foi encerrada para impedir o alastrar da peste, assistiu a suicídios; sobre ela transitaram exércitos em fuga e desfilaram outros vitoriosos; nela foram executados espiões, viu o desmoronar de Impérios, e o nascer de novas nações...

Isabel Lencastre,"Ao longo de quase oitocentos anos, duas mulheres e 32 homens sentaram-se no trono de Portugal. Destes soberanos, apenas seis não tiveram filhos. E dos 26 restantes, só dois não terão tido filhos ilegítimos. Segundo os testemunhos que a História nos deixou, todos os outros foram pais de bastardos.   
Estes filhos ilegítimos dos reis de Portugal assumiram papéis de relevo e cargos influentes, tanto na corte como no estrangeiro. Desempenharam ofícios importantes e diversos - um foi mordomo mor, outro capitão na conquista de Ceuta, outro ainda foi arcebispo de Braga. Dom João I, sendo bastardo, foi um dos reis mais proeminentes de Portugal. E outros houve, por seu lado, que foram líderes da oposição, criando instabilidade e promovendo a rebeldia do povo contra os seus pais e irmãos no poder.   
Reconstituindo a vida de todos estes homens e mulheres, Bastardos Reais revela-nos uma parte escondida e apaixonante da História de Portugal.

Através das palavras finais da narrativa de Retrato em Sépia, o mais recente livro de Isabel Allende, compreendemos a verdadeira dimensão da história de Aurora del Valle (neta de Eliza Sommers, protagonista de Filha da Fortuna). Juntando recordações ilusórias e os fios evasivos de personagens que passaram pelo seu destino, a protagonista procura entender o seu passado. A narrativa, que dá sequência ao romance Filha da Fortuna, começa em 1862, transcorrendo até 1896. Órfã de mãe, durante o parto, Aurora del Valle nasceu no bairro de Chinatown, em San Francisco, em 1880, e foi criada pela enérgica e austera avó Paulina Del Valle. Enovelada com os segredos de família, a protagonista cresce em um ambiente privilegiado, livre de muitas das limitações que oprimiam as mulheres de sua época, mas, infelizmente, vive atormentada por horríveis pesadelos. Retrato em Sépia destaca-se como romance histórico, onde a memória constitui o tema central. Nesta atraente saga familiar, o leitor, reencontrará no decorrer da leitura, alguns dos personagens de Filha da Fortuna e de A Casa dos Espíritos. A AUTORA Isabel Allende, embora de nacionalidade chilena, nasceu em Lima, capital peruana, em 1942. Aos dezessete anos inicia uma intensa carreira como jornalista e escritora. Em 1982, Isabel Allende publica ACasa dos Espíritos, que imediatamente a consagraria como uma das mais brilhantes escritoras da língua espanhola e a colocaria no rol dos escritores latino-americanos mais traduzidos.

Isabel Allende,"Nascido no sul da Califórnia no século XVIII, Diego de la Vega é um rapaz preso entre dois mundos. O pai, um militar aristocrata espanhol, é um importante latifundiário. A mãe, por outro lado, é uma guerreira da tribo indígena Shoshone. Da avó materna, Coruja Branca, aprende os costumes da sua gente, enquanto que do pai aprende a arte da esgrima e como marcar o gado. Durante a infância, cheia de traquinices e aventuras, Diego é testemunha das brutais injustiças que os indígenas norte-americanos enfrentam pela parte dos colonos europeus, e sente pela primeira vez um conflito interior em relação à sua herança. 
Aos 16 anos, Diego é enviado a Barcelona para receber uma educação europeia. Num país oprimido pela corrupção do domínio Napoleónico, o jovem decide seguir o exemplo do seu célebre professor de esgrima, e adere ""À Justiça"", um movimento clandestino de resistência, que se dedica a ajudar os pobres e indefesos. Imerso num mundo de um ambiente de revolta e desordem, enfrenta pela primeira vez um grande rival que vem de um mundo de privilégio. 
Entre a Califórnia e Barcelona, o novo mundo e o velho continente, forma-se a personagem do Zorro, nasce um grande herói e começa a lenda. Depois de muitas aventuras - duelos ao amanhecer, violentas batalhas marítimas com piratas e resgates impossíveis - Diego de la Vega, conhecido também como Zorro, regressa à América para reclamar a propriedade onde cresceu, em busca de justiça para todos aqueles que não podem lutar por si próprios.

Isabel Allende & Mario Pontes,"O LIVRO Eliza Sommers é uma jovem chilena que vive em Valparaíso em 1849, ano em que se descobre ouro na Califórnia. O seu amante, Joaquín Andieta, a abandona, e parte para o Norte decidido a fazer fortuna e ela decide procurá-lo. A viagem infernal, escondida no porão de um veleiro, e a convivência numa terra onde só há homens e prostitutas atraídos pela febre do ouro, transformam a jovem inocente numa mulher fora do comum. Entretanto, toda essa transformação é feita com a ajuda e o afeto de Tao Chi""en, um médico chinês que a protege ao longo de uma viagem inesquecível pelos mistérios e contradições da condição humana. Filha da Fortuna é o retrato palpitante de uma época marcada pela violência e pela cobiça, onde cada protagonista redescobre o amor, a amizade, a compaixão e a coragem.

Isabel Allende,"O LIVRO “Chamo-me Eva, que quer dizer vida. Nasci no quarto dos fundos de uma casa sombria e cresci entre móveis antigos, livros em latim e múmias humanas, embora isso não me tenha tornado melancólica, pois vim ao mundo tendo na memória um hálito de selva.” A oitava edição brasileira de Eva Luna chega às livrarias com um novo projeto gráfico. Terceiro romance da autora hispano-americana, publicado pela primeira vez em 1987, é considerado a obra que consagrou definitivamente Isabel Allende como uma das vozes importantes da literatura contemporânea. Antes, ela publicara A Casa dos Espíritos e De Amor e de Sombra, que já a haviam alçado a um seleto grupo de autores. Em seus primeiros trabalhos, Allende afirmava escrever para arrancar os fantasmas que levava dentro de si e que não a deixavam em paz. Atribuiu à palavra o poder de ressuscitar os mortos, reunir os desaparecidos e reconstruir o mundo perdido. Em Eva Luna, ela também deseja testemunhar e denunciar. Eva Luna, a protagonista e narradora, relata a burlesca história da sua própria vida e das pessoas que encontrou ao longo do caminho. “Os personagens tornam-se a imagem verdadeira de uma coletividade. Para defender suas opiniões e livrar-se de suas obsessões, a romancista cria caracteres e tipos, misturando realidade e imaginação: a madrinha que enlouquece; Mimi, um homossexual; Huberto Naranjo, um guerrilheiro; e Rolf Carlé, um cineasta. Eva, a primeira mulher, tem uma vida de pobreza e de lutas pela sobrevivência, num contexto de caudilhos e de ditaduras militares, em que o povo nunca decide o curso dos acontecimentos.” Por sua crítica e denúncia da realidade social, Eva Luna aproxima-se da tradição do romance picaresco espanhol, cedo implantado na América hispânica. A ironia diante das condições adversas e o humor sempre presente transformam em comédia os momentos mais trágicos. A descoberta de si e do seu corpo conduz Eva Luna à realização plena da sua identidade. Trata-se de um moderno conto de fadas. A AUTORA De nacionalidade chilena, Isabel Allende nasceu em Lima, no Peru, em 1942. Abandonou o Chile após o golpe militar. Aos 16 anos, começou a trabalhar como jornalista e depois como escritora.

Isabel Allende,"Para quem era uma escrava na Saint-Domingue dos finais do século XVIII, Zarité tinha tido uma boa estrela: aos nove anos foi vendida a Toulouse Valmorain, um rico fazendeiro, mas não conheceu nem o esgotamento das plantações de cana, nem a asfixia e o sofrimento dos moinhos, porque foi sempre uma escrava doméstica. A sua bondade natural, força de espírito e noção de honra permitiram-lhe partilhar os segredos e a espiritualidade que ajudavam os seus, os escravos, a sobreviver, e a conhecer as misérias dos amos, os brancos. Zarité converteu-se no centro de um microcosmos que era um reflexo do mundo da colónia: o amo Valmorain, a sua frágil esposa espanhola e o seu sensível filho Maurice, o sábio Parmentier, o militar Relais e a cortesã mulata Violette, Tante Rose, a curandeira, Gambo, o galante escravo rebelde… e outras personagens de uma cruel conflagração que acabaria por arrasar a sua terra e atirá-los para longe dela. Quando foi levada pelo seu amo para Nova Orleães, Zarité iniciou uma nova etapa onde alcançaria a sua maior aspiração: a liberdade. Para lá da dor e do amor, da submissão e da independência, dos seus desejos e os que lhe tinham imposto ao longo da sua vida, Zarité podia contemplá-la com serenidade e concluir que tinha tido uma boa estrela.

Irving Wallace,"Após a morte inesperada do Presidente dos Estados Unidos da América, sucede-lhe Douglas Dilman, presidente em exercício do Senado norte-americano. É uma eventualidade que não ocorrera a ninguém e que a muito poucos agrada. Porque Dilman é também o primeiro afro-americano a ocupar a presidência do país. Assim tem início aquele que viria a tornar-se um dos mais discutidos romances dos anos sessenta, que arrasta o leitor para o centro de um furacão político, em que Dilman tem de fazer face a três realidades conflituosas: a do seu novo cargo, a da sua raça e a da sua vida privada. Desde a primeira até à última página, O Homem é um livro profundamente emocionante. O novo Presidente tem de facto de confrontar-se com uma situação muito complicada, em que as tensões internacionais se juntam a um clima de quase rebelião interna, à violência, ao escândalo e a uma feroz hostilidade para consigo. E o romance aproxima-se vertiginosamente de um clímax, quando pela primeira vez na história norte-americana o Senado se reúne para destituir o Presidente. O Homem foi adaptado ao cinema em 1972, com os actores James Earl Jones, Martin Balsam e Burgess Meredith nos principais papéis.

Uma evocac?o inigualavel do exodo de Paris apos a invas?o alem? de 1940 e da vida sob a ocupac?o nazi, escrito pela ilustre romancista francesa Irene Nemirovsky ao mesmo tempo que os acontecimentos se desenrolavam a sua volta.

O manuscrito foi salvo pela sua filha Denise; foi apenas decadas depois que Denise descobriu que o que tinha imaginado ser o diario da m?e era na verdade uma inestimavel obra de arte, que viria a ser aclamada pelos criticos europeus como um Guerra e Paz da Segunda Guerra Mundial.

O Insubmisso, novo jornal de uma elite em ascensão, perseguirá a história e descobrirá que o pai de Ildo é um cavaleiro tauromáquico aristocrata.

Num país que ainda procura recuperar dos traumas da guerra, Arturo Andrade é chamado a investigar o misterioso assassinato de uma criança em Pueblo Adentro, uma aldeia a poucos quilómetros de Badajoz, a sua cidade natal, e centro da resistência anarquista da Extremadura. 
Arturo cedo se dá conta de que este crime é apenas a ponta do icebergue de uma bem montada rede de tráfico infantil que fez desaparecer mais de 30 mil crianças. Um elemento fundamental deste sórdido esquema é o Auxílio Social, instituição encarregada de «reeducar» os filhos dos prisioneiros republicanos, derrotados na Guerra Civil.

Ildefonso Falcones,"**O best-seller mundial que inspirou a nova série da Netflix** Saga com mais de 6 milhões de exemplares vendidos apenas na Espanha e que inspirou a série homônima disponível na Netflix, A catedral do mar acompanha a vida de Arnau Estanyol. Filho de um servo que escapa dos abusos de seu senhor feudal e se refugia em Barcelona, Arnau tem a vida marcada pelo trabalho árduo e pela devoção à Virgem Maria. A fé liga sua história a um dos principais templos da Catalunha — Santa Maria do Mar —, e a igreja do povo se torna ela mesma um personagem à medida que Arnau acompanha sua edificação. De fugitivo a um dos mais respeitados membros da comunidade barcelonesa, ele acaba se aproximando de perigos cada vez mais intensos, como a temida figura da Inquisição. Mas a bondade do homem para com seus colegas de trabalho, clientes e até mesmo aqueles considerados párias — como mouros e judeus — acaba levando-o longe, ainda que frente a tantos conflitos. De forma raramente encontrada na literatura, A catedral do mar descreve o sistema medieval em detalhes, abordando tanto a arquitetura e a cultura da Barcelona da época quanto suas complexidades jurídicas e financeiras. Ao escrever com evidente paixão sobre um dos períodos mais complicados da história da Catalunha, Ildefonso Falcones construiu este romance épico que se tornou um dos maiores best-sellers recentes da Espanha. **

Las campanas de la iglesia de Santa María de la Mar siguen sonando para todos los habitantes del barrio de la Ribera, pero uno de ellos escucha su repique con especial atención... Hugo Llor, hijo de un marinero fallecido, a sus doce años trabaja en las atarazanas gracias a la generosidad de uno de los prohombres más apreciados de la ciudad: Arnau Estanyol. 
Pero sus sueños juveniles de convertirse en constructor de barcos se darán de bruces contra una realidad dura y despiadada cuando la familia Puig, enemiga acérrima de su mentor, aproveche su posición ante el nuevo rey para ejecutar una venganza que llevaba años acariciando. 
A partir de ese momento, la vida de Hugo oscila entre su lealtad a Bernat, amigo y único hijo de Arnau, y la necesidad de sobrevivir en una ciudad injusta con los pobres. 
Obligado a abandonar el barrio de la Ribera, busca trabajo junto a Mahir, un judío que le enseña los secretos del mundo del vino. Con él, entre viñedos, cubas y alambiques, el muchacho descubre la pasión por la tierra al tiempo que conoce a Dolça, la hermosa sobrina del judío, que se convertirá en su primer amor. Pero este sentimiento, prohibido por las costumbres y por la religión, será el que le proporcionará los momentos más dulces y amargos de su juventud. 
Diez años después de La catedral del mar, Ildefonso Falcones regresa de nuevo a ese mundo que tan bien conoce, la Barcelona medieval. Y lo hace recreando una vez más a la perfección esa efervescente sociedad feudal, prisionera de una nobleza voluble y corrupta, y la lucha de un hombre por salir adelante sin sacrificar su dignidad.

Henryk Sienkiewicz,"Henryk Adam Aleksander Pius Sienkiewicz was born on May 5th 1846, into an impoverished Polish noble family in Russian-ruled Congress Poland. He normally published under the shortened version as Henryk Sienkiewicz. It was only in 1866 that he completed his secondary-school diploma. At first he tried to study medicine, then law, at the Imperial University of Warsaw, but he soon transferred to the university's Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and Old Polish language. His living circumstances meant he was living in poverty and existing only by tutoring the children of other families. In 1868 his circumstances improved when he became tutor to the princely Woroniecki family. In 1869 his analysis of a play was published in the Weekly Review and shortly afterward The Illustrated Weekly printed his essay about the late-Renaissance Polish poet Mikolaj Sęp Szarzyński. Sienkiewicz completed his university studies in 1871, though he failed to receive a diploma because he did not pass the examination in Greek language. However, he was gaining some traction writing for such publications as Gazeta Polska (The Polish Gazette) and Niwa (magazine), under the pen name 'Litwos'. In 1873 he began writing a column, 'Bez tytulu' (Without a title), in The Polish Gazette and, in 1874, one for Niwa, 'Sprawy bieżące' (Current matters), and in 1875 the column, 'Chwila obecna' (The Present Moment). He also collaborated on a Polish translation, published in 1874, of Victor Hugo's last novel, 'Ninety-Three'. In June of the same year he became co-owner of Niwa. This was followed by 'Humoreski z teki Woroszylly' (Humorous Sketches from Woroszylla's Files, 1872), 'Stary Sluga' (The Old Servant, 1875), 'Hania' (Sienkiewicz) (1876) and 'Selim Mirza' (1877). These last three are known as the 'Little Trilogy'. Together these publications made him a prominent figure in Warsaw's journalistic-literary world. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, writing many travel essays which helped win him further popularity with Polish readers. From the 1880s he also began serializing his novels and soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the 19th and 20th centuries. His numerous translations gained him international renown. In Poland he is best known for his 'Trilogy' of historical novels - 'Fire and Sword', 'The Deluge', and 'Sir Michael' all set in the 17th-century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in the rest of the world his fame is set with 'Quo Vardis' an epic in length and scope and set in Emperor Nero's Rome. It easily became the best-selling book of 1897, a enduring and literary sensation. In 1905 he won a Nobel Prize for his lifetime achievements as an epic writer. In his acceptance speech, he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland: ""She was pronounced dead-yet here is proof that she lives on.... She was pronounced defeated-and here is proof that she is victorious.""

Henry James,"Henry James foi um renomado escritor norte americano. James escreveu cerca de vinte romances que tiveram grande aceitação de público e da crítica, tais como: ""Retrato de uma Senhora"", ""A Herdeira"" e ""A Volta do Parafuso"", entre outros. A Herdeira é um romance clássico, ambientado na Nova York de meados do século XIX, uma sociedade ainda bastante provinciana e fechada. A história gira em torno das conquistas e decepções afetivas de Catherine Harrington, uma heroína que fez de Henry James um dos primeiros autores feministas da literatura moderna. Livro sensível, que retrata bem a mulher daquela época, submissa, romântica, o preconceito de classes, além de deixar sempre dúvidas quanto aos reais sentimentos de um belo jovem por uma moça não tão bela, mas com enorme fortuna a receber.

Tentaremos descobrir as suas causas, as suas ligações com o passado e a sua novidade na História. Claro que não poderemos relatar a atividade de todos os movimentos que se disseram ou dizem fascistas, ontem e hoje; mas tentaremos deduzir a especificidade dos mais importantes e avaliar o seu efeito de choque na sociedade dos seus países respectivos.

Helena Marques,"A Lei da Protecção do Sangue Alemão e da Honra Alemã, promulgada pelo Governo do III Reich em Setembro de 1935, desencadeou - como é de todos conhecido - uma perseguição sistemática contra os judeus que ultrapassou as fronteiras do Reich e atingiu núcleos residentes no estrangeiro. Na ilha da Madeira, elementos da comunidade alemã de origem hebraica, ali estabelecidos e integrados, viram-se confrontados com insistentes tentativas de discriminação exercidas por compatriotas seus, não só através de pressões e chantagens directas, mas também de cartas de denúncia anti-semita enviadas para Berlim, com imediatas repercussões na sua vida pessoal e profissional. É a memória desses cidadãos do mundo, do seu sofrimento, da sua resistência e da sua vitória final, que este livro recupera. 
Críticas de imprensa  
«Um dos encantos da narrativa – além de uma escrita de primeira água, despretensiosa e leve – é a instantaneidade do retrato de um Funchal romântico e quotidiano, fixado numa intensa “vida social” que começava, porém, a ressentir-se das tensões exógenas.»

Heinz G. Konsalik,"Sinopse   
Quando aquele médico voltou da Rússia, onde estivera como prisioneiro de guerra, algo quase inexplicável aconteceu: um homem que não falava de si, que não tinha outro desejo senão o de voltar à sua profissão, via, de repente, o seu nome pronunciado por toda a gente.  
A notícia chegara à Alemanha há já algum tempo e rapidamente se espalhara: um médico que se havia sacrificado pelos seus companheiros dos campos de concentração, um homem de quem jamais se ouvira falar, estava agora de regresso à pátria... 
Através do relato das suas incríveis operações, ajudou milhares de outros homens, desconhecidos, que se recompuseram moral e espiritualmente ante o exemplo que lhes era dado, reencontrando a fé e a esperança necessárias para suportar as privações e a solidão na longínqua Rússia. E o exemplo serviu tanto os necessitados como outros médicos, que se sentiram estimulados a seguir o mesmo caminho de abnegação e devoção ao próximo. 
O horror da guerra, a vastidão da estepe russa, o silêncio da morte, tais são os temas dominantes de O Médico de Estalinegrado que mereceu de um prisioneiro o seguinte comentário: ""Para nós, que estivemos em Karaganda, na Sibéria Central, este é o melhor livro até hoje escrito sobre prisioneiros de guerra.""

Haruki Murakami,"O romance que confirmou Haruki Murakami como um dos mais talentosos autores da ficção contemporânea.Um avião prepara-se para aterrar no aeroporto de Frankfurt. Aos ouvidos de Tōru Watanabe chegam os acordes de «Norwegian Wood», a famosa canção dos Beatles. O mítico tema dos Beatles tem o condão de transportar este executivo de 38 anos aos tempos da juventude, vividos na turbulenta Tóquio em finais dos anos sessenta.Saído da casa dos pais com dezoito anos e deixando para trás a pacatez de província e o velho Toyota Corolla da família, Tōru chega à capital japonesa a fim de estudar teatro na universidade instalando-se uma residência estudantil só para rapazes. Filho único e solitário por natureza, passa o tempo a ler O Grande Gatsby e a estudar atentamente os colegas e as pessoas que o rodeiam. Um belo dia, o narrador reencontra um rosto de passado: Naoko, antiga namorada do seu grande amigo de adolescência, Kizuki, antes de este cometer suicídio na flor da idade, depois de vencer um jogo de snooker. Marcados por essa tragédia em comum, os dois começam a dar longos passeios e constroem uma relação delicada na qual a fragilidade psicológica de Naoko se torna cada vez mais evidente culminando com o seu internamento na casa de repouso, onde conhecem Reiko, uma mulher madura com rugas a condizer e um passado trágico. Por esses dias, Watanabe trava ainda conhecimento com Midori: estudante de teatro como ele, símbolo da mulher moderna, lutadora... e dona de uma livraria à moda antiga. Isto sem esquecer a figura impagável de Facho, colega de quarto que faz ginástica matinal ao som do hino e se masturba a olhar para a Ponte de São Francisco.

Haruki Murakami,"Em A Rapariga que Inventou Um Sonho, o autor do best-seller Kafka à Beira-Mar envolve a fantasia com a mais natural das realidades. Do surreal ao mundano, estas histórias exibem a sua habilidade de transformar o curso da experiência humana na mais pura e surpreendente arte literária.Há corvos animados, macacos criminosos, um homem de gelo... Há sonhos que nos moldam e coisas que sempre sonhámos ter... Há reuniões em Itália, um exílio romântico na Grécia, umas férias no Hawai... Há personagens que se confrontam com perdas dolorosas, outras que se deparam com distâncias inultrapassáveis entre os que querem estar o mais próximo possível.Quase todas as histórias são melancólicas, com personagens submersas pela solidão. Murakami junta os seus temas favoritos: os acontecimentos inexplicáveis (o tal toque de fantástico que provoca por vezes a sua inclusão na corrente do realismo fantástico), as coincidências, o jazz, os pássaros e os gatos. Tal como foi escrito no Los Angeles Times Book Review, «Murakami abraça o fantástico e o real, cada um com a mesma envolvência de intensidade e luminosidade.»Haruki Murakami é, cada vez mais, um autor de culto, lido por todas as gerações e procurado com especial curiosidade pelos jovens leitores.

Haruki Murakami,"Nos seus dias de adolescente, Tsukuru Tazaki gostava de ir sentar-se nas estações a ver passar os comboios. Agora, com 36 anos feitos, é engenheiro de profissão e projeta estações, mas nunca perdeu o hábito de ver chegar e partir os comboios. Lá está ele na estação central de Shinjuku, ao que dizem ""a mais movimentada do mundo"", incapaz de despregar os olhos daquele mar selvagem e turbulento ""que nenhum profeta, por mais poderoso, seria capaz de dividir em dois"". Leva uma existência pacífica, que talvez peque por ser demasiado solitária, para não dizer insípida, a condizer com a ausência de cor que caracteriza o seu nome. A entrada em cena de Sara, com o vestido verde-hortelã e os seus olhos brilhantes de curiosidade, vem mudar muita coisa na vida de Tsukuru. Acima de tudo, traz a lume uma história trágica, que a memória teima em não esquecer.Os quatro amigos de liceu, donos de personalidades diferentes e nomes coloridos, cortaram relações com ele sem lhe dar qualquer explicação. Profundamente ferido nos seus sentimentos, Tsukuru perdeu o gosto pela vida e esteve a um passo da morte. A páginas tantas, lá conseguiu não perder a carruagem. Com Os Anos de Peregrinação de Liszt nos ouvidos, regressa à cidade que o viu nascer e atravessa meio mundo, viajando até à Finlândia, em busca da amizade perdida. E de respostas para as perguntas que andam às voltas na sua cabeça e lhe queimam a língua. Será que o rapaz sem cor vai ser capaz de seguir em frente? Arranjará finalmente coragem para declarar de vez o seu amor por Sara?Uma inesquecível viagem pelo universo fascinante deste escritor japonês que chega a milhões de leitores espalhados pelo mundo inteiro.

Pois bem, neste segundo volume, as personagens estreitam laços, mergulhando de cabeça na insondável trama engendrada por Murakami, e as Metáforas Duplas pedem meças às Ideias.Do alto (leia-se, superioridade) dos seus setenta e pouco centímetros, o Comendador faz alarde da proverbial sabedoria e prossegue com as suas diatribes. O pintor e narrador da história, que gosta de preparar uma boa refeição caseira, mas que, em matéria de pensamento abstrato e matemático, é «um zero à esquerda», prefere não fazer como os golfinhos (que têm a capacidade de pôr a dormir a metade esquerda ou a direita do cérebro)... e afoga as mágoas na cozinha e num copo de puro malte escocês. Ah, é verdade, o sino evapora-se e deixa de tocar às duas da matina. E ao narrador só lhe resta responder ao chamamento do poço, que é como quem diz, da câmara de pedra. O mistério adensa-se.À medida que trabalha afanosamente no retrato de Marie Akikawa, dando mostras de ter reencontrado finalmente a sua arte, o pintor recorda ao pormenor a irmã que morreu aos doze anos. Confrontado com o súbito desaparecimento de Marie, parece disposto a tudo para salvar a rapariguinha de treze anos: lutar contra javalis e vespas, os atacantes mais perigosos por aquelas bandas... e cavalos de Troia. Sucedem-se episódios mais ou menos obscuros em que se cruzam memórias de uma Viena ocupada pelos nazis e do Massacre de Nanquim. A Noite de Cristal e a anexação da Áustria por Hitler.

A par de Tengo e Aomame, a voz da Ushikawa ecoa nas páginas do terceiro volume de 1Q84 e provoca as reações mais intensas. Amem-no ou detestem-no, mas deixem-no entregue à sua sorte. Tengo e Aomame continuam sem saber, mas aquele é o único lugar perfeito no mundo. Um lugar perfeitamente isolado e, ao mesmo tempo, o único que escapa às malhas da solidão. Este mundo também deverá ter as suas ameaças, os seus perigos, claro, e estar cheio dos seus próprios enigmas e de contradições. Mas não faz mal. A páginas tantas, é preciso acreditar. Sob as duas luas de 1Q84, Aomame e Tengo deixam de estar sozinhos...

Harry G. Frankfurt,"A desigualdade económica suscita pouco consenso nos tempos que correm. No entanto, poucos argumentariam que a desigualdade é um mal maior do que a pobreza. Os pobres sofrem porque não têm o suficiente e não porque os outros têm muito. 
Neste livro provocador, o autor, um dos filósofos morais mais influentes da actualidade, apresenta uma resposta convincente e perturbadora para os que acreditam que o objectivo da justiça social deve ser a igualdade económica ou menos desigualdade. Argumenta que estamos moralmente obrigados a eliminar a pobreza, não a alcançar a igualdade ou a diminuir a desigualdade. Devemos estar focados em garantir que todos têm dinheiro suficiente para viver uma vida decente. Focar-se, ao invés, na desigualdade é perturbador e alienante. 
Se nos dedicarmos a garantir que todos tenham o suficiente, podemos reduzir a desigualdade como um efeito colateral. Contudo, sublinha que é essencial considerar que o objectivo último da justiça é acabar com a pobreza, e não com a desigualdade. Trata-se de um livro com grande impacto num dos grandes debates do nosso tempo.

Hannah Rothschild,"Nica Rothschild nasceu no seio de uma familia rica. Casou com um bar?o e era m?e de cinco filhos. Parecia destinada a uma vida facil e convencional. Uma viagem a Nova Iorque mudou tudo. Estava ja a caminho do aeroporto quando ouviu uma musica tocada por um pianista desconhecido, Thelonious Monk. Nica ouviu a gravac?o vinte vezes seguidas, perdeu o avi?o e nunca mais voltou para casa. Acabava de nascer a paix?o abrasadora que viria a consumir o resto dos seus dias. Como que enfeiticada, largou tudo e instalou-se em Nova Iorque. E a cidade rendeu-se. O seu Bentley descapotavel passou a ser presenca familiar a porta dos clubes de jazz. A vis?o de Nica a fumar e a beber whisky de uma garrafinha disfarcada de Biblia era uma constante. Foi deserdada mas a sua influencia n?o conheceu limites.

Hannah Mary Rothschild,"Um quadro velho e sujo é comprado numa obscura loja de velharias por Annie McDee. Chef talentosa mas falida, apaixonada mas com o coração partido, Annie cedeu a um impulso e gastou nele as últimas 75 libras que tinha no bolso. E enquanto se debate com a solidão e a falta de perspetivas, está longe de imaginar as repercussões da sua humilde extravagância.  
É que, singelamente pendurada entre os tachos e as panelas da sua cozinha, está agora uma obra-prima. A Improbabilidade do Amor é o quadro perdido de um célebre pintor do século XVIII. Na tentativa de desvendar a verdadeira identidade da obra, Annie vai deparar com um dos segredos mais bem guardados da História da Europa.  
E ser inadvertidamente arrastada para o frenético mundo da arte e perseguida por potenciais compradores. De uma princesa árabe a um oligarca russo, passando por um conde falido e uma socialite americana, não falta quem esteja disposto a tudo para acrescentar mais uma peça à sua coleção.  
Mas A Improbabilidade do Amor não é apenas uma obra de arte.  
A sua alma é-nos gradualmente revelada. Na sua voz sedutora, sofisticada e muito cínica, o quadro comenta a atribulada vida amorosa de Annie, narra a sua própria história e ajusta contas com os seus (muitos) donos anteriores, entre eles, Luís XV, Voltaire e Catarina, a Grande…

Testament XXI is the story of the time of showdown, one hundred years after Doomsday, when men still yearned to learn the meaning of their continued existence, and when all that humanity had held sacred for two thousand years had been perverted to a continued drive for mortal ambitions.

Gustave Flaubert,"Excerpt from Salambo The present version is important in more ways than one. It makes available to English readers the book which is held by competent judges to be Flaubert's supreme contribution to the art of the novel, and it restores to circulation a very remarkable example of translation which can hold its own in that long sequence of renderings which stretches from Florio to Scott Moncriefi'. Only those who have tried to translate from Flaubert know what difficulties have to be encountered. The work of theconscious Stylist always presents a problem of great intricacy to those who would make an acceptable version of its completeness for foreign readers. But that problem is not wholly insoluble. Proust developed a highly conscious Style, but it has been found not impossible to convey something of its quality to an English public. It is not Flaubert's insistence on the mot juste that most tests the translator's ingenuity. Even for mots justes there should be equivalents. It is those elements in his writing for which nothing Similar can be found in English that bring despair. Proust, in a long and acute essay on Flaubert's style, pointed to certain peculiarities in his use of the imperfect tense. He employed it in a highly personal way, and found it rich in possibilities for the presentation of extended narrative. The imperfect, with its implications of unresolved continuity, could give effects obtainable in no other way. But there is nothing comparable in English, where the use of the imperfect has become less and less idiomatic. That Mr. Powys Mathers managed to produce so fine and faithful a translation without having to his hand a grammatical form upon which Flaubert set such store, is remarkable. Mr. Mathers is, alas, dead. This publication is of his, as of Flaubert's, Salambo. Both men are honoured and commemorated in the monument.

Günter Grass,"«O Pregado traça um panorama da história germânica, com comicidade e sem pudores, dando ênfase às relações entre o homem e a mulher e a evolução alimentar. Narrado na primeira pessoa, a história inicia-se ainda no Neolítico, quando a mulher subjugava o homem, e termina na tumultuada Polónia da década de 1970. A personagem principal, que reencarna de geração em geração, possui nove esposas referentes a cada época da sua vida incomum. No início de sua trajectória, o homem pesca um pregado, um estranho peixe falante que o acompanha e aconselha ao longo dos tempos. É o pregado que incita o homem a manusear o metal e com ele desvincular-se do poder feminino, e o encoraja a gerar guerras e supremacias. Dividido em nove capítulos, cada um relativo a um mês de gestação, O Pregado é um livro magistralmente escrito e conduzido, onde Günter Grass une elementos da mitologia alemã, da sabedoria popular e das concepções vanguardistas feministas. O Pregado, romance-chave da obra de Günter Grass, constitui uma reflexão sobre o papel dos sexos em cada época e em como esse papel poderá transformar-se no futuro, sem repetir os erros do passado.» - De [http://www.casadasletras.pt/catalogo/...](http://www.casadasletras.pt/catalogo/detalhes_produto.php?id=51683)

Guilherme de Azevedo,"A mais conhecida obra poética de Guilherme de Azevedo, um dos “poetas revolucionário” da chamada “Geração de 70″ (de 1870), que é no fundo uma coletânea dos seus melhores poemas.
Obra poética que marca bem a ruptura da poesia sentimentalista e romântica para a “Poesia de Combate”, assim chamada pela “Geração de 70″ ou “Geração de Coimbra”, que foi um movimento acadêmico de Coimbra, do século XIX, que veio revolucionar várias dimensões da cultura portuguesa, da política à literatura, sobretudo com a introdução do “Realismo” literário.
Quando em 1874 saiu a “Alma Nova”, o livro despertou uma grande curiosidade e uma certa polêmica nos círculos literários. Tal como o próprio título da obra já dava a indicar, esta exponha esse anseio por uma literatura colocada ao serviço das ideias democráticas e revolucionárias defensoras de uma nova ordem social que despontam um pouco por toda a Europa.

Graham Greene,"De Graham Greene apresenta–se finalmente ao leitor português uma antologia de particular significação. O mundo da infância em confronto com o dos adultos, o sobrenatural humanamente integrado nos fenómenos quotidianos, o homem isolado na sua circunstância, a trágica e apologética intensidade da dúvida e, em contrapartida, a devastante ironia à vacuidade das crenças acomodatícias e epidérmicas – eis alguns dos temas exemplarmente tratados nestas páginas. José Palla e Carmo escreveu para este volume um extenso ensaio, no qual destrinça os diferentes escopos de Greene como romancista ou contista; apresenta, a seguir, um conjunto de dados biográficos inéditos em Portugal, da maior importância para a compreensão da personalidade do autor. Finalmente, analisa algumas das razões que tornam Graham Greene um dos mais sintomáticos representantes da literatura moderna. Aí se focam pontos como a responsabilidade e a escolha; o Isolamento e a incomunicabilidade; a solidariedade humana; o caminho neo–pascaliano para a esperança a partir da angústia do absurdo; o herói contemporâneo em contraste com o herói tradicional.

Günter Grass,"Com um olhar retrospectivo lançado ao ano de 1959, Pilenz conta-nos acerca do admirado e desprezado colega de turma Mahlke, na Danzig dos tempos da guerra, cuja maçã-de-adão maior do que o normal faz dele uma espécie de figura à margem. Mahlke era seguido, amado, invejado pelos seus colegas do liceu pela sua estranha postura em relação a Deus, à Virgem Maria e pela chave de parafusos que traz ao pescoço. Mahlke trava um combate desesperado pela sua integração, pela colmatação da brecha existencial entre «Gato» e «Rato», e acabará por, na vitória, falhar. É uma obra que através do choque de um adolescente com o meio hostil do liceu representa uma crítica à sociedade nacional-socialista dos tempos da guerra. 
The provocative story centers on the narrator's vivid recollection of a boyhood scene in which a black cat is provoked to pounce on his friend Mahlke's ""mouse""--his prominent Adam's apple. This incident sets off a wild series of utterly Grassian events that ultimately leads to Mahlke's becoming a national hero. Because of Grass's singular storytelling virtuosity, *Cat and Mouse* is marvelously entertaining, powerful, and full of funny episodes.

Graham Greene,"Este romance - o mais lido no século XX, em língua inglesa - é fruto de uma viagem que Graham Greene fez às terras de Tabasco para conhecer a perseguição religiosa que teve lugar nos anos vinte, no México.   
O livro descreve as peripécias e os dramas do único sacerdote católico que continuava a exercer, clandestinamente, o seu ministério. Perseguido pela polícia, carregava consigo as cicatrizes do tempo: os gestos denunciavam um passado diferente e um temor em relação ao futuro. Não era nem herói nem santo, vivia como fugitivo, cheio de medos, com a consciência de ser um pecador, com o remorso de ter uma filha e, embora debilitado pela bebida, dizia zombeteiramente que com um pouco de conhaque era capaz de desafiar o demónio.   
Um romance comovente em que, para este padre perseguido e fraco, a fé é uma certeza que não se deixa determinar pelas misérias.

Gonçalo M. Tavares,"Numa trama imprevisível, em que os personagens são atraídos e apartados pela dor, pelo desejo e pela loucura, um dos principais nomes da nova literatura portuguesa constrói uma alegoria perturbadora sobre as relações de dominação entre os homens. O médico Theodor Busbeck anda empenhado em descobrir se o horror está aumentando ou diminuindo ao longo da História. Ele pretende traçar um gráfico para prever novos massacres. Mylia, sua ex-mulher, tem a capacidade de ver a alma e sofre de uma dor lancinante no ventre. Acabou internada num hospício pelo próprio marido, e ali se relaciona com o interno Ernst. Gomperz, diretor do hospício, mantém uma amizade ambígua com Theodor e desperta cada vez mais ódio em seus pacientes. Kaas tem as pernas magras e problemas de dicção. Hanna é uma prostituta que vive com Hinnerk, um ex-combatente que atemoriza as crianças do bairro. Tratando de relações de dominação, desejo, repulsa e agressividade, Jerusalém costura a vida desses personagens em direção a um desenlace violento e inesperado. Ocupados em compreender e lidar com os limites da sanidade, todos se sentem acossados por um perigo sem nome. Num estilo seco e desconcertante, Jerusalém aponta para as dimensões pessoais e coletivas do terror e expõe a capacidade humana de vigiar, oprimir e torturar - às vezes em dimensões hiperbólicas.

Herman Melville & Giorgio Agamben,"Ao indagar, neste volume, acerca dos pressupostos implicados na privação da função de escrivão a que se abandonara Bartleby, Agamben transforma a análise deste paradigma numa das mais densas meditações acerca dos pressupostos inerentes ao exercício da sua condição de escritor e filósofo, apresentando simultaneamente as figuras e modos que compõem o seu método. Trata-se, aqui, de um «experimento sem verdade», no qual «quem se aventura, arrisca, de facto, não tanto a verdade dos próprios enunciados quanto o próprio modo do seu existir e realiza, no âmbito da sua história subjectiva, uma mutação antropológica a seu modo tão decisiva quanto foi, para o primata, a libertação da mão na posição erecta, ou, para o réptil, a transformação dos membros anteriores que o mutou em pássaro».

Com reviravoltas surpreendentes, Sharp Objects: Objetos cortantes narra o retorno da repórter Camille Preaker, recém-saída de um hospital psiquiátrico, à sua cidade natal para investigar o brutal assassinato de uma menina e o desaparecimento de outra. Desde que deixou a pequena Wind Gap, no Missouri, oito anos antes, Camille quase não falou com a mãe neurótica, o padrasto e a meia-irmã que praticamente não conhece. Hospedada na casa da família, a jornalista precisa lidar com as memórias difíceis de sua infância e adolescência.

O acusado do crime foi seu irmão mais velho, que acabou condenado à prisão perpétua. Desde aquele dia, Libby passou a viver sem rumo. Uma vida paralisada no tempo, sem amigos, família ou trabalho. Mas, vinte e quatro anos depois, quando é procurada por um grupo de pessoas convencidas da inocência de seu irmão, Libby começa a se fazer as perguntas que até então nunca ousara formular. Será que a voz que ouviu naquela noite era mesmo a do irmão? Ben era considerado um desajustado na pequena cidade em que viviam, mas ele seria mesmo capaz de matar? Existiria algum segredo por trás daqueles assassinatos? Gillian Flynn intercala a trajetória detetivesca de Libby com flashbacks dos acontecimentos do dia dos crimes com tanta habilidade que o leitor é levado a diferentes direções.

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind. 
Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever. 
Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice. 
From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.

Gabriela Ruivo Trindade,"João José Mariano Serrão foi um republicano convicto que contribuiu decisivamente para a elevação de Estremoz a cidade e o seu posterior desenvolvimento. Solteiro, generoso e empreendedor como poucos, abriu lojas, cafés e uma oficina, trouxe a electricidade às ruas sombrias e criou um rancho de sobrinhos a quem deu um lar e um futuro. É em torno deste homem determinado, mas também secreto e contido, que giram as cinco vozes que nos guiam ao longo destas páginas, numa viagem que é a um tempo pessoal e colectiva, porque não raro as estórias dos narradores se cruzam com momentos-chave da história portuguesa. Assim conheceremos um adolescente que espreitava mulheres nuas e ria nos momentos menos oportunos; a noiva cujos olhos azuis guardavam um terrível segredo; um jovem apaixonado pela melhor amiga que vê a vida subitamente atravessada por uma tragédia; a mãe que experimentou o escândalo e chora a partida do filho para a guerra; e ainda a prostituta que escondia documentos comprometedores na sua alcova e recusou casar-se com o homem que a amava. Por fim, quando estas vozes se calam, é tempo de ouvirmos o protagonista através de um diário escrito noutras latitudes e ressuscitado das cinzas muitos anos mais tarde.  
Baseado em factos reais, Uma Outra Voz é uma ficção que nos oferece uma multiplicidade de olhares sobre a mesma paisagem, urdindo a história de uma família ao longo de um século através das revelações de cada um dos seus membros, numa interessante teia de complementaridade.

Garth Nix,"Esta obra convida-nos a entrar num mundo mágico, não muito alheado do real, mas onde o espaço e o tempo acabam por revelar ligeiras diferenças, ligeiras flutuações nos seus ritmos, fendas misteriosas por onde se insinuam espíritos maléficos, seres enigmáticos, encantamentos secretos. A própria fronteira entre a vida e a morte atenua-se, do outro lado da Muralha, onde se estende o Reino Antigo. Quando um mensageiro lhe entrega a espada de Abhorsen, o Necromante, e os sete sinos de prata capazes de dominar os vivos e os mortos, Sabriel sabe que o pai e o Reino Antigo correm perigo. Determinada a encontrar o pai e a lutar contra uma ameaça inominável, a jovem parte rumo às profundezas do desconhecido numa jangada heróica, apoiada somente pela petulante criatura que usa a forma de um gato branco, Mogget, e por Touchstone, um jovem soldado cujo passado esconde um terrível mistério. Que forças irão os três defrontar? E que destino estará reservado a Sabriel? Uma história absorvente, destinada a tornar-se um clássico.

É lá que acompanhamos diversas gerações dessa família, assim como a ascensão e a queda do vilarejo.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Publicado em 1872, «Os Possessos» é um romance de cariz político inspirado na história verdadeira de um assassinato que chocou a Rússia. Em 1869, um grupo de reformadores liberais, mais conhecidos por niilistas, assassinou um elemento do seu próprio grupo no meio de uma conspiração contra o czar. Dostoiévski parte do assassinato e do julgamento que se lhe seguiu para construir a sua obra, que funciona também como um manifesto contra a ideologia materialista que, segundo ele, estava a contaminar a sua pátria. O resultado é uma obra-prima profética ambientada na Rússia pré-Revolução, que antevê o pesadelo estalinista.

Analista rigoroso do comportamento humano, Dostoiévski analisa em detalhe o sentimento de culpa desencadeado pelo assassinato de um pai e debate de forma sublime as infindáveis dicotomias da natureza humana, revelando uma inquietação que é já a do homem moderno.

Os dois últimos títulos ficarão para sempre associados às circunstâncias conturbadas que envolveram a sua concepção — «Nétotchka Nezvánova», originalmente projectado por Dostoiévski para ser um romance, foi abruptamente interrompido pela prisão do autor, que só anos mais tarde o viria a concluir, com grandes alterações, e optando por transformá-lo num conto; «O Pequeno Herói» foi escrito durante o encarceramento na cela solitária da Fortaleza de Pedro e Paulo.

A um povoado perdido na América do Sul chegou a hora má dos camponeses, a hora da desgraça. Certo amanhecer, enquanto o Padre Ángel se prepara para celebrar a missa, ouve-se um tiro na aldeia. Um comerciante de gado, informado da infidelidade da mulher por um papel colado na porta da sua casa, acaba de matar o seu presumível amante. É um dos pasquins anónimos cravados durante a madrugada nas portas das casas, que não são panfletos políticos mas apenas denúncias sobre a vida privada dos cidadãos, e que nada revelam que não seja do conhecimento de todos há algum tempo. São os velhos boatos que agora se tornam públicos: traições amorosas e políticas, assassinatos, segredos de família envolvendo filhos bastardos e romances escusos. Todos se sentem atingidos e ameaçados, dos cidadãos mais eminentes aos mais humildes. Todos parecem ter algo a esconder e a revelar.

São Petersburgo está mergulhada em mais uma de suas noites brancas, fenômeno que as faz parecerem tão claras quanto os dias e que confere à cidade a atmosfera onírica ideal para o encontro entre essas duas almas perdidas. Em apenas quatro noites, o tímido rapaz e a misteriosa Nástienhka passam a se conhecer como velhos amigos, mas algo vem atrapalhar o desenrolar romântico deste fugaz encontro. Publicada em 1848, esta história faz parte do ciclo de obras que Dostoiévski (1821-1881) criou após amargar uma forte desilusão amorosa e é a última escrita antes da prisão e do período de exílio na Sibéria.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Universalmente considerado como um dos iniciadores da literatura moderna, Dostoiévski é também em muitos aspectos um precursor do pensamento de Freud pela admirável compreensão das motivações profundas e não conscientes, do sofrimento psíquico, da linguagem dos sonhos, dos laivos de loucura que caracterizam os comportamentos. Neste conto, o autor trata de um tema muito divulgado nas literaturas europeias de meados do século XIX, especialmente na francesa: o argumento narra um triângulo amoroso – marido, mulher e amante – através da voz de um homem rico e indolente, que é confrontado com o marido, depois viúvo, da sua amante. 
À semelhança de «O Idiota», já publicado nesta colecção, em «O Eterno Marido» o ciúme é o tema-chave; mas, enquanto naquele livro os conflitos são vividos, através de uma perspectiva cómica, por personagens dotados de grande força interior, em «O Eterno Marido» dá-se a dramatização do tema, logo esse sentimento é elaborado em função de um personagem cheio de fragilidades, propenso a uma passividade que o expõe ao ridículo, e as suas tentativas de abafar os seus ressentimentos e alcançar a felicidade a todo o custo acabam por se exteriorizar assumindo os contornos do crime. No entanto, mais do que esta compreensão que Dostoiévski possui em relação aos comportamentos, fascinam-nos a sua intuição poética e o seu alcance filosófico, que nos deixam perante o enigma do psiquismo humano como mistério insondável que não obedece a qualquer lei da vida material. 
Considerado pela crítica mundial como um dos mais perfeitos trabalhos de Dostoiévski, «O Eterno Marido», publicado pela primeira vez em revista corria o ano de 1870, só no ano seguinte teria a sua primeira edição em livro. Esta versão em língua portuguesa, da responsabilidade de Nina Guerra e Filipe Guerra, é fruto de um trabalho de tradução feito directamente a partir do russo.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"“Cadernos da Casa Morta reflectem uma realidade quase dantesca, onde presos políticos, prisioneiros de guerra e presos de delito comum, vivem lado-a-lado com homens que perpetraram crimes hediondos. É «um mundo absolutamente à parte», uma micro-sociedade com regras próprias onde o quotidiano se reparte entre os trabalhos forçados, os castigos sádicos, a miséria, o mercado negro, o álcool e os pequenos expedientes de que os prisioneiros se servem não só para sobreviverem, mas para usufruírem da ilusão de fugazes momentos de «liberdade»... Privado de livros e de papel, Dostoiévski redige as suas notas em materiais que consegue recolher e que lhe permitem registar apontamentos de um realismo impressionante e de uma poderosa vitalidade, a par das suas reflexões pessoais sobre a natureza humana. Escrito em tom confessional, sóbrio e directo, este relato fica, para quem o lê, como um grandioso hino à vida.”

Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"Datado de 1866, este é o primeiro dos grandes romances que Dostoiévski escreveu já em plena maturidade literária, sendo provavelmente a mais bem conhecida de todas as suas obras. Recriando um estranho e doloroso mundo em torno da figura do estudante Raskólnikov, perturbado pelas privações e duras condições de vida, é uma das obras por excelência fundadoras da modernidade. Pelo inexcedível alcance e profundidade psicológica, sobretudo no que implica a exploração das motivações não conscientes e a aparente irracionalidade nos comportamentos das personagens, este autor russo tornou-se uma referência universal na literatura, sem perda de continuidade até aos nossos dias.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky,"«Gente Pobre» marca a estreia de Dostoiévski na literatura, em 1846, e estabelece desde logo os fundamentos para uma abordagem social, psicológica e profundamente corrosiva da compreensão humana. A análise pormenorizada das personagens e suas convicções, enquadradas por um pano de fundo de crítica subtil, ganha em Dostoiévski uma força e um poder imagéticos que extravasam as páginas dos seus livros. Em «Gente Pobre», o autor transporta-nos para um dos bairros mais miseráveis de São Petersburgo, onde um funcionário de meia-idade troca correspondência com uma jovem costureira. Demasiado pobres para se casarem, o seu amor passa todo e apenas por cartas mantidas ao longo do tempo, que refletem a cruel realidade do dia a dia passado num ambiente de extrema precariedade.

Fredrik Backman,"Elsa tem sete anos de idade, quase oito, e é diferente. Para já, tem como melhor - e única - amiga a avó de setenta e sete anos de idade, que é doida: não levemente taralhoca, mas doida varrida a sério, capaz de se pôr à varanda a tentar atingir pessoas que querem falar sobre Jesus com uma arma de paintball, ou assaltar um jardim zoológico porque a neta está triste. Todas as noites, Elsa refugia-se nas histórias da Avozinha, cujo cenário é o reino de Miamas, na Terra-de-Quase-Acordar, um reino mágico onde o normal é ser diferente. Quando a Avozinha morre de repente e deixa uma série de cartas a pedir desculpa às pessoas que prejudicou, tem início a maior aventura de Elsa. As cartas levam-na a descobrir o que se esconde por detrás das vidas de cada um dos estranhíssimos moradores de um prédio muito especial, mas também à verdade sobre contos de fadas, reinos encantados e a forma como as escolhas do passado de uma mulher ímpar criam raízes no futuro dos que a conheceram.

Frédéric Martel,"Best-seller do New York Times. Lançado simultaneamente em vinte países. Um relato sobre a corrupção e a hipocrisia no coração do Vaticano. ""Por trás da rigidez há sempre qualquer coisa escondida: em numerosos casos, uma vida dupla."" Ao pronunciar estas palavras, o papa Francisco tornou público um segredo que esta investigação vertiginosa explora, pela primeira vez, com grande detalhe. No armário do Vaticano expõe a decadência no coração do Vaticano e na Igreja Católica atual. Um trabalho brilhante baseado em quatro anos de pesquisas rigorosas, que inclui entrevistas com dezenas de cardeais e encontros com centenas de bispos e padres. O celibato dos padres, a condenação do uso de contraceptivos, os inúmeros casos de abuso sexual, a renúncia do papa Bento XVI, a misoginia entre os clérigos, a trama contra o papa Francisco — todos esses temas estão envoltos em mistério. Este livro revela a face escondida da Igreja, uma instituição fundada em uma cultura clerical de sigilo e baseada na vida dupla de padres e numa extrema homofobia. A esquizofrenia resultante na Igreja é difícil de entender: quanto mais um prelado é homofóbico, mais é provável que ele seja gay.

Com este livro Frédéric Masson dá-nos a conhecer as mulheres na vida de Napoleão e os diferentes papéis que nela desempenharam. Algumas conseguiram, inclusive, condicionar as decisões políticas deste grande homem.
Uma obra interessante que nos relata um período histórico repleto de conspirações políticas que, em alguns casos, poderão muito bem ter sido despoletadas pelo poder do olhar sedutor de uma bela mulher...

Fundamentando-se na moral cristã, atribui à mulher função subalterna à do marido e um âmbito geográfico que terminaria nas quatro paredes da casa: a seu ver, a mulher deveria ser praticamente analfabeta e submissa para ser feliz.

Florbela Espanca,"[http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/masc...](http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/mascaras-do-destino/)
Uma série de contos escritos por Florbela Espanca, totalmente dedicados à memória do irmão da poetisa, Apeles Espanca, que faleceu tragicamente num acidente de aviação a 6 de Junho de 1927. A obra reúne os contos: “O Aviador”, “A Morta”; “Os Mortos não Voltam”; “O Resto é Perfume”; “A Paixão de Manuel Garcia”; “O Inventor”; “As Orações de Soror Maria da Pureza”; “O Sobrenatural”. 
Este livro é o livro de um Morto, este livro é o livro do meu Morto. Tudo quanto nele vibra de subtil e profundo, tudo quanto nele é alado, tudo que nas suas páginas é luminosa e exaltante emoção, todo o sonho que lá lhe pus, toda a espiritualidade de que o enchi, a beleza dolorosa que, pobrezinho e humilde, o eleva acima de tudo, as almas que criei e que dentro dele são gritos e soluços e amor, tudo é d’Ele, tudo é do meu Morto! 
Obra publicada em 1931, um ano após a morte da poetisa, mas foi escrita em 1927, logo após a morte do irmão de Florbela. 
Muito se tem discutido sobre a natureza da relação de Florbela como o seu irmão Apele, havendo muitas especulações se a poetisa sentia pelo irmão algum amor platónico em segredo; se esse era um sentimento reciproco e mantinham ambos uma relação incestuosa; ou se tudo era fruto de uma forte ligação de amizade fraternal. Especulações à parte, o que se sabe é que Florbela via no irmão, segundo palavras suas, a sua “verdadeira alma gémea”; alguém lhe estava intelectualmente mais próximo e que, simultaneamente, representava o elo com a infância e o ponto de apoio firme da poetisa. Quando ela oscilava entre um sentimento de desvalorização de si própria e o desejo de ser valorizada, era a influência de Apeles que a conduzia ao equilíbrio. 
Quando, em 1927, Apeles decide tirar o curso de piloto-aviador e falece, pouco depois, vítima da queda, no Tejo, do hidro-avião que pilotava, dá-se o maior choque da vida da poetisa, que se confronta com o absurdo da morte, precisamente no momento em que se começava a adaptar à família do terceiro marido. Desse violentíssimo choque Florbela nunca mais foi a mesma, passando a viver permanentemente deprimida, doente dos nervos, fumando em demasia e a emagrecendo sensivelmente. Passa a viver em reclusão, guardando religiosamente no seu quarto dois pedaços do avião do irmão que foram resgatados, abandona a poesia e passa para a prosa, escrevendo sobre a estranheza da morte e do conforto da mesma. 
É nesse período que escreve “As Máscaras do Destino”, obra dedicada “ao seu morto”, a quem a autora dirige as palavras de exaltação e dor. Apesar disso encontram-se na obra frases de grande beleza e força com expressões de desejo, carregadas de erotismo, tanto como sofrimento e morte. O conto “O Aviador” é exemplo disso pois descreve uma visão mítica da morte do irmão amado. 
Terminada a obra, que lhe serviu como meio de escape, Florbela tentou arranjar uma editora que lhe publicasse o livro, mas sem resultado. Foi considerado demasiado deprimente e confuso. Só seria publicado um ano depois do seu suicido.

Filipe Faria,"As Crónicas de Allaryia são já um clássico da high fantasy portuguesa, aproximando-se, com este quinto volume, do furioso clímax da odisseia iniciada cinco anos atrás. Neste novo capítulo das Crónicas de Allaryia, os companheiros que deram início a uma quase ingénua demanda n A Manopla de Karasthan estão separados, perdidos, desesperançados. Embora poucos o saibam, a esperança reside em Aewyre Thoryn, mas cada um dos companheiros terá um papel a desempenhar no vindouro conflito. Privados do poder da sua união, vêem-se confrontados com a iminente imersão de Allaryia nas trevas que todos já julgavam desbaratadas. Porém, Seltor, o precursor destas, aprendeu com os erros do passado e os seus propósitos não aparentam de todo ser o que dele se espera...

Aewrye e os seus companheiros tentam chegar a Asmodeon e descobrir o mistério do desaparecimento de Aezrel Thoryn, mas muitos obstáculos têm de enfrentar. Separados, os companheiros têm de sobreviver às provações que se lhes depararão: Quenestil e Babaki partiram em busca de Slayra e dos seus captores e o resto do grupo que segue para as inóspitas estepes de Karatai em perseguição de Kror, o enigmático drahreg que partilha com o jovem Thoryn a Essência da Lâmina, um segredo milenar dos guerreiros de Allaryia. Nos obscuros espaços das trevas, o Mal vai estendendo os seus múltiplos e mortíferos tentáculos. Há um perigo oculto do qual as gentes de Allaryia ainda não se aperceberam mas Pearnon, o escriba, pressente-o sem no entanto o poder transmitir. O primeiro volume foi publicado em Abril deste ano, quando Filipe Faria tinha ainda 19 anos. Considerado como a obra que iniciou o género da High Fantasy em Portugal, está prevista a continuação em mais cinco poderosos volumes sobre este fantástico mundo de Allaryia.

Depois de muitas eras que alternaram entre a paz e a discórdia, encontramos, neste primeiro volume das Crónicas de Allaryia, uma ameaça que mina a paz aparente. Algo inumano e monstruoso, se move nas trevas sedento de sangue. Allaryia perdeu o seu campeão, Aezrel Thoryn, e mais do que nunca precisa de proteção. Aewyre Thoryn, o filho mais novo do saudoso rei, pega na espada do seu pai e parte a caminho de Asmodeon. O que o jovem guerreiro não podia prever era que a sua demanda pessoal se iria transformar, ao sabor dos encontros, na demanda de um grupo de seres singulares que se reforça pelos laços de amizade que vão unir, conferindo-lhe a força necessária para enfrentar qualquer inimigo.

Fialho D' Almeida,"«Não tinha a menor ideia do que fosse ter mãe ou ter amigas. No seu contacto com a gente, entrevira apenas o tenebroso fundo de bestialidade que referve em cada homem, com um fragor de luxúria cruel. Vivera sempre em si própria, sem a reminiscência dum carinho que alma piedosa lhe houvesse prodigalizado. Quantos beijos deixara roubar aos moços do cemitério e quantas palavras tinha merecido aos gatos-pingados, todas vinham ervadas da mesma ideia e do mesmo intento. E assim crescera naquela incultura de espírito sem guia, sentindo dentro avigorar-se-lhe apenas uma tendência — a da cadela fértil, que vai entregar-se. Através da sensação rudemente nascida olhara o mundo, esfaimada e torpe como se fora um verme descomunal das sepulturas, incapaz, pelos desolados cenários que tinha contemplado nos seus dias de criança, de dar acesso na sua alma às multíplices emoções e susceptibilidades histéricas que fazem da mulher o precioso receptor das coisas mais subtis que a língua não exprime e os olhos mal sabem formular. (…) Foi o tio Farrusco quem cobriu de terra, sem comoção nem saudade, o corpo, espedaçado pelo seu escalpelo, da rapariga corroída de podridões sinistras, abandonada do berço ao túmulo, e pasto unicamente de desejos infames e de desvairamentos vis.»

Fernando Pessoa,"'Não sou nada.Nunca serei nada.Não posso querer ser nada.À parte isso, tenho em mim todos os sonhos do mundo.'Álvaro de Campos foi o heterônimo mais produtivo da obra conhecida de Pessoa. Ao que parece, o poeta muitas vezes o utilizou como um alter ego, além de mero heterônimo. Disto resultou uma obra muito extensa em que se entrecruzam temas e estilos de escrita por vezes dissonantes entre si, próprios da mente de um poeta que se dividiu em muitas personalidades distintas.Esta edição não trará **todos** os poemas de Álvaro de Campos, dentre outras razões pelo fato de que há muitos que simplesmente são dissonantes demais dos outros para que coubessem numa mesma linha poética. O que tentei fazer aqui, então, foi uma seleção dos melhores poemas de Álvaro. Para tal, procurei privilegiar sua fase final, onde se aproximou quase que definitivamente do próprio Pessoa, enquanto ignorei boa parte de sua fase inicial, principalmente os poemas demasiadamente longos.Aos que se preocupam se alguns poemas clássicos foram deixados de fora, quero lembrar que 'Tabacaria', 'A partida', 'Poema em linha reta', 'Lisbon revisited' e todos os demais que seguem este mesmo estilo se encontram todos aqui.Na medida do possível, procurei ordenar os poemas selecionados por ordem cronológica. No entanto, sabemos que o próprio Pessoa costumava assinar alguns poemas com datas fictícias, então não há como se ter certeza absoluta de que todos foram efetivamente escritos nesta ordem.

Fernando Pessoa,"Coletânea de contos de teor filosóficos e humorístico encontrados no espólio de Fernando Pessoa. 
""A liberdade para todos só pode vir com a destruição das ficções sociais."" 
Em Dezembro de 1935, poucos dias depois da morte de Fernando Pessoa, ao ser revisto o seu apartamento onde vivera nos últimos anos da sua vida, descobriu-se algo surpreendente: uma arca contendo mais de 25 mil páginas, com poemas, contos, correspondência, diários, peças dramatúrgicas, documentos esotéricos, projetos literários inacabados e uma infinidade de tantos outros textos que aprofundam mais o enigma e a genialidade que era Fernando Pessoa. 
Deste espólio (considerado tesouro nacional em 2009) já saíram vários trabalhos que Fernando Pessoa nunca chegou a publicar em vida – sendo o mais importante deles, o já famoso “Livro do Desassossego” – e ainda hoje continuam a sair publicações com inéditos de Pessoa, compilados a partir de um extenuante trabalho de organização das imensas páginas dispersas. 
De todos os trabalhos inéditos de Pessoa, os mais relevantes serão, possivelmente, os seus contos. Apesar de muitos transmitirem a sensação de estarem incompletos, ou de não terem uma estrutura linear, o valor dos mesmos está no seu caráter filosófico e nas ponderações que colocam sobre várias fações da vida, da morte e da espiritualidade do Homem, em geral. 
No presente volume, reúnem-se os seguintes contos: 
O Banqueiro Anarquista – O seu melhor e mais conhecido conto, sobre um banqueiro que se descreve a si mesmo como um “anarquista”, que ama a liberdade e odeia as imposições sociais, e que acha que a melhor forma de se ver livre das amarras da sociedade e da influência do dinheiro… é adquirir o máximo dinheiro possível para que ele deixe de ser um problema. 
Na Farmácia do Evaristo – Um conto de contornos político-filosóficos, sobre dois indivíduos que se encontram numa farmácia, num domingo, e entram logo em confronto um com o outro devido aos acontecimentos que se deram na manhã daquele dia: 18 de Abril de 1925 – uma revolta militar, também conhecida por “Golpe dos Generais”, desencadeada contra as instituições da Primeira República Portuguesa. 
No Jardim de Epíteto – Texto filosófico curto, sobre a mensagem epicurista de um “mestre” sobre a vida e a natureza. 
Um grande português – Um conto cómico sobre como um homem (pertinentemente chamado “Vigário”), se livrou de uma dívida que tinha com os irmãos. 
A Pintura do Automóvel – Uma história mais ou menos humorística de carácter publicitário. Não tem moral nem filosofia e serve apenas para ilustrar o tipo de artigo de teor publicitário que Fernando Pessoa chegou a fazer e que aparecia no Diário de Noticias nas décadas de 1920-30. 
Na Floresta do Alheamento – Monólogo existencial de um homem que se vê imerso numa floresta. É um texto puramente filosófico sobre a Sensação e a Razão, articulado com a obra “Meditações” de René Descartes. 
A Hora do Diabo – Conto filosófico com contornos teológicos, sobre uma mulher que ao voltar de um baile de máscaras vai para a cama e sonha com o Diabo que lhe vem contar sobre as suas mágoas. Mas será mesmo um sonho?

Ajudante de guarda-livros na cidade de Lisboa, ele escreve sem encadeamento narrativo claro, sem fatos propriamente ditos e sem uma noção de tempo definida. Ainda assim, foi nesta obra que Fernando Pessoa mais se aproximou do gênero romance. Os temas não deixam de ser adequados a um diário íntimo: a elucidação de estados psíquicos, a descrição das coisas, através dos efeitos que elas exercem sobre a mente, reflexões e devaneios sobre a paixão, a moral, o conhecimento.

Fernando Pessoa,"Nono lançamento da obra de Fernando Pessoa (Lisboa, 1888-1935) pela Companhia das Letras, Aforismos e afins traz à tona a vertente de exímio frasista do poeta português. Esta edição, que mantém a ortografia portuguesa original, é resultado de um cuidadoso trabalho de estabelecimento de texto, e traz um breve aparato crítico que, embora preparado por um especialista - Richard Zenith -, não se distancia dos interesses do leitor comum. Pessoa cultivou os aforismos ao longo de sua vida, e neles deixou transparecer toda a sua sagacidade, com a qual, por exemplo, foi capaz de definir algo tão complexo como a filosofia em apenas uma linha: ""é a lucidez do intelectual chegando à loucura"". Mesmo as frases extraídas de obras consagradas, quando isoladas do contexto, carregam em si múltiplos significados, que transbordam para além de seu intuito original. Parece ser essa a idéia que o poeta expressa, na voz do heterônimo Bernardo Soares, quando diz que ""Tudo quanto o homem expõe ou exprime é uma nota à margem de um texto apagado de todo. Mais ou menos, pelo sentido da nota, tiramos o sentido que havia de ser o do texto; mas sempre fica uma dúvida, e os sentidos possíveis são muitos.

F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Para o narrador - o aristocrata Nick Carraway -, Jay Gatsby representava tudo pelo que ele tinha um desprezo sincero. Proprietário de uma luxuosa mansão em Long Island, ""o grande Gatsby"" é rico, poderoso e promove festas suntuosas, nas quais artistas, escritores, astros de cinema, esportistas, gângsteres e belas garotas em busca de ascensão social se misturam. Ambientado na década de 1920, o romance de Fitzgerald reflete a estrutura de um país em vertiginoso processo de enriquecimento, com o advento do pós-guerra. É uma década de prosperidade e liberdade nos Estados Unidos, movimentada pelo som do jazz e pelo encanto das melindrosas. A elite destilava charme e ostentação, as festas eram luxuosas e animadas, os valores morais sofriam transformações. E ninguém poderia escrever melhor sobre a Era de Ouro americana do que Scott Fitzgerald, membro de destaque da ""Geração Perdida"" da literatura americana. Fitzgerald, ao lado de Zelda Sayre, sua esposa, transitou muito bem entre as mais sublimes festas da elite americana, levando um estilo de vida boêmio que condizia bem com a época.

Eva Mozes Kor,"As portas do vagão abriram-se pela primeira vez em muitos dias e a luz do dia brilhou sobre nós. Agarrei bem a mão da minha irmã gémea quando nos empurraram para a plataforma. - Auschwitz? É Auschwitz? Que sítio é este? - Estamos na Alemanha - foi a resposta. Na verdade, estávamos na Polónia, mas os Alemães tinham invadido a Polónia. Era na Polónia alemã que se situavam todos os campos de extermínio. Os cães rosnavam e ladravam. As pessoas do vagão começaram a chorar, a berrar, a gritar todas ao mesmo tempo; todos procuravam os seus familiares à medida que eram afastados uns dos outros. Separavam homens de mulheres, filhos de pais. Um guarda que ia a passar a correr parou bruscamente à nossa frente. Olhou para Miriam e para mim nas nossas roupas a condizer: «Gémeas! Gémeas!», exclamou. Sem dizer uma palavra, agarrou em nós e separou-nos da nossa mãe. Miriam e eu gritámos e chorámos, suplicámos, as nossas vozes perdidas entre o caos, o barulho e o desespero, tentando chegar à nossa mãe, que, por sua vez, tentava seguir-nos, de braços estendidos, com outro guarda a retê-la.

Eugen Ruge,"SINOPSE Uma saga familiar que acompanha a história do século XX Uma saga familiar que nos transporta no espaço e no tempo para contar a história de uma família alemã desde os anos 50, passados no exílio mexicano, até à revolução de 1989. A narrativa magistral leva-nos à Sibéria e a Berlim Oriental, escalando os cumes e traçando os abismos do século XX ao longo do caminho. O resultado é um panorama impressionante e uma monumental novela alemã, que torna a própria História tangível através da história de uma família. Uma novela de estatura imensa assente numa profunda humanidade, rigor e sentido de humor. O Tempo em Que a Luz Declina concentra-se em três gerações. Os avós, comunistas convictos, regressados à Berlim Oriental do início da década de 1950 para se implicarem na criação de um novo Estado. O seu filho que, depois de ter emigrado para Moscovo e de ter sido banido para a Sibéria, regressa a um país mergulhado em valores pequeno-burgueses. Traz consigo uma esposa russa e a convicção inabalável de que podem mudar o mundo. Enfim, o neto, que se sente cada vez mais limitado a uma casa que não escolheu e que se dirige para o Ocidente exatamente no dia em que seu avô, o patriarca da família, faz 90 anos. O brilho de uma utopia política que outrora resplandeceu, e que parecia atraente, vai-se desvanecendo gradualmente à medida que o tempo passa inexoravelmente.

Ernest Hemingway,"Misturando ficção e autobiografia, Hemingway nos brinda com Verdade ao amanhecer, auto-retrato bastante revelador e crônica dramática de seu último safári na África. Escrito em 1953, quando voltava de uma temporada no Quênia, a obra tece uma história rica em humor e beleza. A história começa no momento em que Pop, famoso caçador, entrega a Hemingway a responsabilidade pela área de caça onde está seu safári. O fato coincide com rumores de que o território poderá ser atacado por uma organização africana que se opõe ao poder colonial dos ingleses. Enquanto o ataque não vem, Mary, a esposa de Hemingway, empenha-se em caçar um leão pelo qual está obcecada. Acrescentando ao seu dramático painel humano pinceladas de fino humor, Hemingway captura a excitação da caça aos grandes animais selvagens, assim como a incomparável beleza do cenário africano, as grandes planícies cobertas de neblina cinzenta, o perfil de zebras e gazelas contra o horizonte, gritos de hiena ferindo a noite escura e gelada. Nesta obra, o autor satiriza, entre outras coisas, o papel da religião organizada na África. Reflete também sobre o próprio ato de escrever e sobre o papel do autor no estabelecimento da verdade.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ernest Hemingway\Verdade ao amanhecer (2609)\cover.jpg,9788528619669,2015-04-30T14:50:37+01:00,Editora Bertrand Brasil,3,,1.0,"Biography & Autobiography, Editors; Journalists; Publishers, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros",Verdade ao amanhecer,2609
Ernest Hemingway,"Paris é uma festa revela um Hemingway diferente. Em Paris, aos 22 anos, ele lê, pela primeira vez, clássicos como Tolstói, Dostoievski e Stendhal. Convive com Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, figuras polêmicas e encantadoras para o jovem Hemingway. A cidade e esses ""companheiros de viagem"" deram-lhe nova dimensão do humano e maior sensibilidade para alcançar os seus dois objetivos primordiais na vida: ser um bom escritor e viver em absoluta fidelidade consigo próprio. Há, em Paris é uma festa, momentos de suave melancolia, alternados com outros de cortante, quase selvagem crueldade. O livro começou a ser escrito no outono de 1957, em Cuba, e foi finalizado na primavera de 1960. Após ter escrito Paris é uma festa, Hemingway recapturou, durante algum tempo, a felicidade perdida, o gosto da juventude, vividos naquela época.

A convite do pai, Lara decide passar o Verão longe da poluição de Londres e sob o sol da Toscana. É aí que conhece a família Willoughby, cuja piscina é palco das mais indolentes e voluptuosas tardes. Ricos, sensuais e manipuladores, rapidamente a envolvem nas suas alianças familiares e conspirações.

Ernest Hemingway,"Em 1959, a revista Life encarregou Ernest Hemingway de fazer a cobertura de um acontecimento extraordinário que ia ter lugar em Espanha, durante esse Verão. Com efeito, estava previsto que aí se defrontassem, na arena, dois dos maiores e mais celebres toureiros de todos os tempos, Antonio Ordonez e Luís Miguel Dominguin. Para Hemingway, tratava-se de retomar um tema clássico: um campeão lendário que enfrentava um jovem que o vinha desafiar. Hemingway viveu durante alguns meses junto dos dois toureiros e do seu circulo de amizades. E a reportagem que escreveu, muito maior do que aquela que a revista lhe tinha encomendado, acabou por tornar-se neste livro, uma das suas obras-primas e o seu derradeiro grande livro, antes de se suicidar no ano seguinte.

Ernest Hemingway,"O enredo de O Sol Nasce Sempre (Fiesta) decorre na Europa após o termo da Primeira Guerra Mundial. Se exceptuarmos o toureiro Pedro Romero, todos os seus outros personagens principais se expatriaram dos Estados Unidos da América ou da Grã-Bretanha. E todos eles, quer tivessem vindo em busca de aventura ou de algo indefinido com que preencher o vazio das suas vidas, tinham acabado por instalar-se em Paris. Esta celebrizara-se, nos anos 20, graças à boémia esfuziante dos seus cafés e da sua intelectualidade. Aí se podiam, com efeito, encontrar pintores como Picasso, Miró ou Matisse, ou mulheres como a americana Gertrude Stein, que criara uma tertúlia onde diversos artistas plásticos ou escritores como James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald e Ernest Hemingway se juntavam para trocar ideias. Mas se Paris garantia assim a todos uma vida interessante, a verdade é que muitos a sentiam também como vazia. De modo que, à semelhança aliás do que acontecera a Hemingway e a alguns dos seus amigos, um certo número de personagens deste romance pretenderão escapar à sofisticação e à corrupção da grande cidade, refugiando-se no universo mais tradicional da Espanha daqueles anos. E porque muitos se reconheceram neste retrato de uma geração sem raízes, O Sol Nasce Sempre (Fiesta) tornou-se rapidamente um romance de culto para os jovens europeus do período de entre as duas guerras.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Ernest Hemingway\O Sol Nasce Sempre (Fiesta) [The Su (2614)\cover.jpg,9781451655469,2011-08-02T14:33:39+01:00,Simon and Schuster,3,,1.0,"Fiction, General, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros, Literary, Colecção Dois Mundos",O Sol Nasce Sempre (Fiesta) [The Sun Also Rises],2614
Ernest Hemingway,"Um romance de amor e obsessão, *O Jardim do Éden* conta a história de um jovem escritor americano e da sua mulher, em prolongada lua-de-mel pela costa mediterrânica de França e Espanha, e da jovem por quem ambos se sentem atraídos. 
David Bourne começa a receber cartas do editor com boas críticas ao seu segundo romance. Está ansioso por recomeçar a escrever, mas, afinal, ainda se encontra em lua-de-mel. 
Catherina, sua mulher, encoraja-o a escrever, mas, na verdade, ressente-se com a separação. As tentações que lhe coloca à frente culminam numa ligação com outra mulher mais jovem e mais sensual, num jogo erótico e perigoso entre os três. 
Hemingway revela aqui muita da ternura e vulnerabilidade geralmente obscurecidas pela sua imagem pública. Catherine Bourne é uma das suas mais complexas e convincentes heroínas.

Emma Byrne,"Dizer palavrões pode parecer fútil – e, para alguns, pouco civilizado –, mas é uma parte incrivelmente útil da linguagem, que mostra como os nossos cérebros, emoções e até as sociedades funcionam. Os palavrões existem desde que os humanos começaram a comunicar e está provado que dizê-los diminui a dor e ajuda vítimas de AVC a recuperar a linguagem. Dizer Palavrões Faz Bem é uma divertida e espirituosa defesa dos nossos tão apreciados palavrões, baseada na mais credível investigação científica e case studies históricos – desde os chimpanzés que inventaram as suas próprias «asneiras» ao homem que depois de perder metade do cérebro ganhou uma compulsão para praguejar. Emma Byrne apresenta a fascinante ciência por detrás do calão, explicando como se reflecte nos nossos corpos e mentes e como praguejar não só é normal como, efectivamente, faz bem.  «Uma impressionante colectânea de investigação que mostra como dizer palavrões nos ajuda a lidar com a dor, a ligar-nos aos outros, está associado à inteligência e nos torna mais dispostos a confiar uns nos outros [...] Uma leitura inspiradora.» Financial Times Com uma linguagem muito descontraída, coloquial, pontuada por alguns palavrões, a autora, esclarece a origem dos palavrões, contextualiza o seu uso em termos sociais, culturais e até internacionais.Enuncia estudos que demonstram a relação que têm com a nossa inteligência, como proferi-los alivia o stress e reduz a dor, como podem ajudar-nos a recuperar de algumas doenças. No fundo, explica por que dizer palavrões é bom para quem os diz.  Para explicar que dizer palavrões não apenas é normal, como até faz bem, a autora contextualiza os seus argumentos baseando-se na sociologia, psicologia, neurociência e antropologia. Há um capítulo apenas dedicado às mulheres, que faz o enquadramento histórico do preconceito relacionado com mulheres que recorrem ao calão e contribui para a desmistificação e a igualdade de género. A própria autora se assume como uma mulher que diz muitos palavrões, e com muito gosto.

With eccentric, dark humor, Emile Souvestre portrays a society dominated by mechanization and greed. However comically exaggerated, the unmistakable echoes of real problems and possibilities in Souvestre's satire make this book science fiction's earliest warning against the dangers of mechanization in a society ruled by consumerism.

The stories have locations as diverse as Africa and the Caribbean, London and Los Angeles, San Francisco and Switzerland. Some are modern; some period. Some feature well-known sleuths - Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, Jemina Shore - or notorious villains - Jack the Ripper; others are tales of 'ordinary' people caught up in out of the ordinary events.

Elisabeth Gifford,"Profundamente apaixonados e prestes a casar, os estudantes Misha e Sophia fogem da Polónia, procurando escapar à ocupação nazi da capital, Varsóvia. Obrigados a regressar ao gueto, resta-lhes ajudar o mentor de Misha, o Dr. Korczak, a cuidar das 200 crianças que vivem no seu orfanato, conseguindo, assim, sobreviver. 
Do outro lado do muro, a violência aperta as suas garras em torno deste pequeno oásis de esperança e bondade, criado pelo bom doutor de Varsóvia, e Misha e Sophia são obrigados a separar-se e a enfrentar os seus piores medos sozinhos. 
Mas, apesar de todos os esforços em preservar alguma humanidade em pleno caos, numa manhã de agosto de 1942, o chamado Pequeno Gueto é cercado pelas tropas das SS, com instruções para encaminhar os seus ocupantes para Treblinka, o campo para onde quem vai nunca volta. O Dr. Korczak não desiste da sua missão e recusa abandonar as crianças e funcionários do orfanato, partindo com eles para o destino final. 
O gueto de Varsóvia foi habitado por meio milhão de pessoas. Menos de um por cento sobreviveu para contar a sua história. Este romance é inspirado nos relatos reais de Misha e Sophia e na vida de um dos heróis silenciosos da Grande Guerra, o Dr. Janusz Korczak.

Elena Ferrante,"A Amiga Genial é a história de um encontro entre duas crianças de um bairro popular nos arredores de Nápoles e da sua amizade adolescente.  
Elena conhece a sua amiga na primeira classe. Provêm ambas de famílias remediadas. O pai de Elena trabalha como porteiro na câmara municipal, o de Lila Cerullo é sapateiro.  
Lila é bravia, sagaz, corajosa nas palavras e nas acções. Tem resposta pronta para tudo e age com uma determinação que a pacata e estudiosa Elena inveja.  
Quando a desajeitada Lila se transforma numa adolescente que fascina os rapazes do bairro, Elena continua a procurar nela a sua inspiração.  
O percurso de ambas separa-se quando, ao contrário de Lila, Elena continua os estudos liceais e Lila tem de lutar por si e pela sua família no bairro onde vive. Mas a sua amizade prossegue.  
A Amiga Genial tem o andamento de uma grande narrativa popular, densa, veloz e desconcertante, ligeira e profunda, mostrando os conflitos familiares e amorosos numa sucessão de episódios que os leitores desejariam que nunca acabasse.

Eduardo Sá,"Entramos no mundo dos nossos filhos num misto de fascínio e perplexidade. É o nosso mundo. São os nossos filhos. Mas eles não nos pertencem. E caminham pela vida (se tudo correr bem) com uma crescente autonomia. Fazemos esse percurso juntos. Sonhamos para eles um destino. Umas vezes, levamo-los ao colo. Noutras, porém, sem se saber muito bem como, entramos num labirinto (de emoções, de vontades) onde perdemos a ideia do caminho. Em Queremos Melhores Pais! o psicólogo Eduardo Sá mostra-nos que há quase sempre uma saída. As angústias mais comuns - quer seja a lidar com a birra do mais novo ou com a conta de telemóvel do mais velho - são aqui respondidas. E descobrimos pistas para compreender as histórias da família, os fantasmas que se criam (a crise, o divórcio), os mitos infundados (como o tão incompreendido mimo). Mas sempre com ternura. E por vezes num tom provocatório, que desafia e questiona. Eduardo Sá é Psicólogo Clínico e Psicanalista.

She possessed extraordinary telepathic powers - and in the 1990s telepathy was the ultimate weapon in psychological warfare. Vanessa, along with other gifted children, was virtually a prisoner at Random Hill Residential School, developing her abilities for Government exploitation. 
So when she escaped, Vanessa became a political embarrassment. Questions were asked by the Opposition. It was vital for the Prime Minister, the ruthless dictatorial Sir Joseph Humbolt, that everything that marked Vanessa's existence should be erased. And orders were given that she should be hunted down - using telepaths like herself - and destroyed.

Atrasa-se. Talvez se afunde nos abismos que um psicólogo garantiu existirem no seu interior. Talvez se perca no outro lado do mundo, em Bangladesh, onde nunca faz frio.

Donna Woolfolk Cross,"No ano de 814, Idade Média, que ficou conhecida como a Idade das Trevas, as mulheres eram impedidas de estudar, podiam ser estupradas e até mortas pelos maridos. O conhecimento estava sufocado, os países hoje conhecidos na Europa não existiam, nem os idiomas modernos. Cada região tinha o seu dialeto e a lingua culta era o latim, herdada do Império Romano, que já havia sido derrubado pelas invasões bárbaras. Foi neste período sombrio que uma mulher passou a maior parte de sua vida vestida de homem, estudou medicina, foi médica do papa e tornou-se ela mesma papisa - durante dois anos. A história da Papisa Joana foi conhecida até o século XVII, quando o Vaticano resolveu apagá-la da história da Igreja. Não adiantou. Dona Woolfolk Cross pesquisou, descobriu os arquivos e achou a história tão fascinante que a transformou num romance, em que aventura, sexo e poder cruzam-se com maldições, guerras e heresias.

Donato Carrisi,"Todos nós já sentimos, em algum momento, o desejo de desaparecer. De deixar tudo para trás. Para alguns, isso transforma-se numa obsessão que os consome e engole, até que acabam por desaparecer na escuridão. Todos se esquecem deles. Todos, menos Mila Vasquez, investigadora do Gabinete das Pessoas Desaparecidas. 
Sem que ninguém o conseguisse prever, indivíduos que se esfumaram no vazio há vários anos regressam com intenções obscuras. Uma série de crimes, sem relação aparente entre si, traz consigo uma descoberta surpreendente: os seus autores são pessoas que se pensava desaparecidas para sempre. Onde estiveram durante tanto tempo? E porque regressaram? Qual o plano maléfico a que obedecem? 
Mila percebe que para travar este exército das trevas não lhe bastam os indícios. Tem de dar à escuridão uma forma, um sentido, precisa de formular uma hipótese sólida, convincente, racional…

Don Winslow,"A guerra chegou a casa. Há quarenta anos que Art Keller está na primeira linha de fogo do conflito mais longo da história dos EUA: a guerra contra a droga. A sua obsessão por derrotar o chefe mais poderoso, mais rico e mais letal do mundo, o líder do cartel de Sinaloa, Adán Barrera, causou-lhe cicatrizes físicas e mentais, teve de se despedir de pessoas que amava e até perdeu parte da sua alma. Agora, Keller é o diretor da DEA e descobre que, ao destruir o monstro, surgiram outros trinta que estão a causar ainda mais caos e destruição no seu amado México. Porém, isso não é tudo. O legado de Barrera é uma epidemia de heroína que está a assolar os EUA. Keller atira-se de cabeça para travar este fluxo mortal, mas encontrar-se-á rodeado de inimigos, pessoas que querem matá-lo, políticos que querem destruí-lo e ainda pior: uma nova administração que está envolvida com os traficantes de drogas que Keller quer destruir. Art Keller está em guerra não só com os cartéis, mas com o seu próprio governo. A longa luta ensinou-lhe mais do que alguma vez imaginara e, agora, aprenderá a última lição: não há fronteiras. ""O novo romance de Don Winslow é um contrabando de 'droga muito pura' a cujo lado, a serie The Wire parece um entretenimento inócuo.""

Domingos Amaral,"E se D. Afonso Henriques não fosse filho de D. Teresa? 
Incapaz de vencer Afonso Henriques nos campos de batalha, o seu primo direito e imperador da Hispânia, Afonso VII, lança contra ele uma intriga infame. Nascido com deficiências nas pernas e aleijadinho, Afonso Henriques teria sido trocado à nascença por outro menino. Assim, o verdadeiro filho do conde Henrique e de Dona Teresa não é o usurpador que usa o seu nome, mas talvez um dos filhos de Egas Moniz, que terá inventado um milagre de Nossa Senhora para encobrir a sinistra troca das crianças.  
A primeira a conhecer esta tenebrosa malícia é Chamoa Gomes, eterna paixão de Afonso Henriques, que por amor começa a investigar a história, ao mesmo tempo que Egas Moniz e outros notáveis portucalenses a tentam afastar da corte, pois não querem que ela seja a primeira rainha de Portugal.  
Ao longo de sete anos, Chamoa Gomes e Lourenço Viegas, o filho mais velho de Egas Moniz e narrador da história, vão tentar descobrir o que passou trinta e tal anos antes, aquando do nascimento de Afonso Henriques e também no dia da morte de seu pai, o conde Henrique.  
Enquanto o mistério se adensa, o reino de Portugal cresce no norte e no sul, em lutas permanentes contra os leoneses de Afonso VII e os muçulmanos da Andaluzia. Apesar de falhada uma primeira tentativa de tomar Lisboa aos mouros, Afonso Henriques é reconhecido rei em Zamora, casa com Mafalda de Sabóia e conquista ainda a cidade de Santarém. Mas é só durante o segundo cerco a Lisboa, durante o qual os portucalenses contam com a fundamental ajuda dos cruzados vindos do Norte da Europa, que a vil intriga de Compostela se virá a esclarecer.

Dmitry Merezhkovsky,"Na ressaca do obscurantismo da Idade Média, surge o movimento Renascentista, fulcral na civilização europeia e que teve na Itália o seu foco irradiante. 
As ciências e as artes renasceram, buscando no passado as suas musas inspiradoras. A redescoberta e a revalorização das referências culturais da antiguidade clássica passaram a nortear as mudanças deste período, rumo a um ideal humanista e naturalista. É neste contexto que surgem os génios artísticos e científicos que marcaram para sempre a sociedade europeia e o mundo inteiro. 
Este livro, centrado na vida de Leonardo da Vinci, conduz-nos numa viagem no tempo, fazendo-nos conviver com algumas das personagens mais marcantes da época, e de todos os tempos: Francisco Sforza, Maquiavel e o «Príncipe» que o inspirou --- César Bórgia --- , Miguel Ãngelo, o grande rival de Leonardo, Rafael, a família Médici, o papa Alexandre VI (Rodrigo Bórgia), entre muitos outros. 
Pintor, escultor, arquiteto e engenheiro, Leonardo da Vinci foi o talento mais versátil da Itália do Renascimento. Os seus desenhos, combinando uma precisão científica com um grande poder imaginativo, refletem a enorme vastidão dos seus interesses, que iam desde a biologia, à fisiologia, à hidráulica, à aeronáutica e à matemática. 
Durante o apogeu do renascimento, Da Vinci, enquanto anatomista, preocupou-se com os sistemas internos do corpo humano, e enquanto artista interessou-se pelos detalhes externos da forma humana, estudando exaustivamente as suas proporções. 
Com ideias demasiado evoluídas para a época, este génio foi desconsiderado pelos seus pares, terminando os seus dias, tal como viveu toda a sua vida, envolto em dívidas e numa solidão quase completa. 
Uma excelente obra para quem pretender explorar o percurso do homem, detentor de uma das mais brilhantes mentes de toda a humanidade.

Mas agora, de férias nas majestosas e misteriosas Highlands, Claire planeia revelar à sua filha uma verdade tão impressionante como os acontecimentos que lhe deram origem: o mistério de um antigo círculo de pedras, um amor que transcende os limites do tempo e a verdadeira identidade de James Fraser, um guerreiro escocês cuja valentia levou uma Claire ainda jovem da segurança do seu século de vida para os perigos de um outro tempo.

Desidério Murcho,"O ensino da filosofia tem sofrido de uma incompreensão fundamental da natureza da própria filosofia. Por um lado, afirma-se que a filosofia é “o lugar crítico da razão”; mas a prática real do ensino e do estudo da filosofia consiste em repetir fórmulas gastas. Este livro oferece a professores e estudantes elementos estruturantes para que o ensino e o estudo da filosofia possa fazer jus à verdadeira natureza da filosofia. Fruto do trabalho do autor no Centro para o Ensino da Filosofia da Sociedade Portuguesa de Filosofia, é imprescindível para professores e estudantes de filosofia que querem fazer da filosofia o que ela deve ser: um estudo vivo e estimulante, criativo e crítico. Com este livro, compreende-se o que é filosofar e como isso se ensina.

A filha, preocupada, decide levá-lo para Oslo, onde vive com o marido. Um dia, quando o deixa sozinho no apartamento, Sheldon ouve ruídos na escada. Percebe que é uma vizinha a ser perseguida, a tentar proteger desesperadamente um filho pequeno. A mulher acaba por ser morta selvaticamente. Mas o octogenário consegue, in extremis, esconder a criança dos perseguidores. É o ponto de partida de um romance onde tudo nos surpreende. Aos poucos, juntamos as peças do puzzle.

Num último esforço para se redimir, assume como missão salvar o filho da vizinha. Numa terra desconhecida para ambos, começa uma fuga épica, que os levará aos confins da Noruega - e uma perseguição implacável, movida por um gangue kosovar.

E à medida que todas as outras pessoas importantes na sua vida a vão igualmente abandonando, Kya aprende a ser autossuficiente: sensível e inteligente, sobrevive completamente sozinha no pantanal a que chama a sua casa, faz amizade com as gaivotas e observa a natureza que a rodeia com a atenção que lhe permite aprender muitas lições de vida.

David R. Wheeler,"""Há vinte anos atrás, meus pais levaram-me de visita aos meus avós, que moravam na zona florestal do norte da Luisiana. Aí, contraí uma pneumonia e tive de ser levado para um hospital em Shreveport. Na altura do internamento tinha febre muito alta e respirava com dificuldade. Depois de ter estado hospitalizado vários dias estava fraco, quase à beira da morte.
A certa altura apercebi-me de que ia morrer. A percepção que tinha do mundo em redor alterou-se. O quarto do hospital, de paredes claras e cheio de sol, tornou-se escuro, parecendo apenas iluminado pelas brasas mortiças de um fogão invisível. Os objetos no quarto não passavam de meras sombras da sua matéria inicial. A cama, os lençóis e a mesa de cabeceira a poucos centímetros da minha cabeça, pareciam pintados de um tom vermelho alaranjado.
Ouvia apenas uns sussurros, mas não tinha a certeza se esses sons seriam fruto da minha imaginação ou o murmúrio de espíritos que ali estivessem perto.
A minha consciência foi-se obscurecendo e o mundo que me rodeava transformou-se num túnel de paredes que refletiam uma luz vermelho-alaranjada. Era um túnel quente e acolhedor. Sentia-me como se estivesse a olhar para o brilho do fogão de um abrigo de montanha numa estância de ski, depois de ter passado o dia inteiro lá fora, ao frio. O fogo atrai-nos e faz-nos sentir seguros.
Enquanto jazia na cama do hospital, o quarto tornou-se mais escuro e o túnel prolongou-se. Os ruídos e as vozes em redor foram-se desvanecendo; já nem sequer ouvia o meu próprio arfar. De repente, senti um grande bem estar. Depois, percebi que algo se transformara dentro de mim. Nunca me acontecera nada de semelhante até então, nem voltou a acontecer. Mas lembro-me muito bem de tudo.""

Camus David,"Uma excelente reconstituição histórica da época das Cruzadas. Uma magistral combinação de feitos de armas e elementos fantásticos e esotéricos numa aventura de ritmo imparável. 
Ano de 1187, Hattin (Terra Santa): após derrotar clamorosamente a fina flor do exército cristão, Paladino arrebata aos Francos a Vera Cruz, relíquia das relíquias de toda a Cristandade, o próprio lenho onde Cristo havia sido crucificado e que acompanhava os exércitos ao campo de batalha em todos os combates decisivos. Morgennes, cavaleiro-monge da ordem dos Hospitalários, nomeado guardião da Vera Cruz, recupera a consciência em Hattin entre um mar de mortos, moribundos e aves de rapina. Capturado e torturado pelos Sarracenos, aceita renegar a sua fé e converter-se ao Islão, para supremo escândalo e desgosto dos seus pares, que o amaldiçoam. Em busca da própria redenção e da salvação da Jerusalém cristã, ameaçada pelo avanço das tropas de Paladino, Morgennes empreende uma demanda pela Vera Cruz, na esperança de que esta ajude a recuperar o poderio perdido dos Francos. Nesta sua missão, cruzar-se-á com aliados como Taqui, o sobrinho favorito de Paladino, a bela e misteriosa Cassiopeia, acompanhada pelo seu falcão, Massada, o vendedor de relíquias, Rufinus, o bispo decapitado cuja cabeça, conservada num cefalotáfio, continua a falar, entre outras personagens e animais maravilhosos. A aventura de Morgennes, rodeado de inimigos e perigos insuspeitos, parece irremediavelmente votada ao fracasso, mas uma força invisível parece, ao mesmo tempo, guiá-lo, acompanhá-lo e protegê-lo. Será ela suficiente para o salvar do Inferno? Com este romance inspirado, história de uma redenção e aventura fantástica mergulhada num século XII de contornos lendários e obscuros, David Camus reencontra o fôlego das grandes epopeias, de que oferece aos seus leitores ‹ que se contam já por muitas e entusiásticas dezenas de milhares em vários países e línguas ‹ uma versão moderna e de rara força.

Danielle Gowevitch & Marie-Thérèse Raepsaet-Charlier,"Gladiadoras, comerciantes, chefes de empresa, parteiras, prostitutas, feiticeiras ou camponesas… estes eram apenas alguns dos ofícios exercidos pelas mulheres na Roma antiga. Apesar de os romanos só serem capazes de imaginar as suas mulheres no interior da casa, presas ao trabalho doméstico, elas ocupavam-se frequentemente de muitas outras coisas. A realidade ultrapassa, por vezes, não só a ficção, como a própria ideologia.  
Contudo as mulheres romanas mantiveram-se oficialmente excluídas da vida política, e jamais adquiriram direito à expressão pública das suas ideias: mesmo quando sabiam escrever não eram autorizadas a publicar, e as suas obras são-nos ainda hoje, muitas vezes, desconhecidas. É pois através dos textos escritos pelos homens que é possível descobrir o que foi a vida das romanas.   
As autoras deste livro levaram a cabo um verdadeiro inquérito para descobrir a realidade dessas mulheres. Pois que, ainda que alguns nomes brilhantes, trágicos ou sinistros, subsistam na memória colectiva - Agripina, Octávia, Lívia, Messalina - a maioria delas deixou apenas indícios dispersos, peças de um puzzle que a obra procura reconstituir.

O Confessor, parte de uma “trilogia acidental sobre o tema inesgotável do Holocausto” (Daniel Silva), encena uma crise na Igreja Católica, questiona a conivência do Vaticano com as atrocidades cometidas pelo regime Nazi, e inicia-nos nos meandros da vida dupla de Gabriel Allon, talentoso restaurador de arte e ex-agente dos Serviços Secretos de Israel.  
A história cruza as vidas de três personagens emblemáticas: um Papa que pretende revolucionar a Igreja e abrir os arquivos do Vaticano; um assassino a soldo que é um mito na história do crime europeu; um anti-herói obcecado com a ideia de vingança e empenhado em restabelecer a verdade.

Daniel Cole,"UM CORPO SEIS VÍTIMAS  Com protagonistas imperfeitos, carismáticos e únicos, aliados a um ritmo veloz e a um delicioso humor negro, Boneca de Trapos é o mais promissor dos thrillers na literatura policial contemporânea. William Fawkes, um controverso detective conhecido por ""Wolf"", acabou de ser reintegrado no seu posto após ter sido suspenso por agressão a um suspeito. Ainda sob avaliação psicológica, Fawkes regressa ao activo, ansioso por um caso importante. Quando se encontra com a sua antiga colega e amiga, a inspectora Emily Baxter, num local de crime, tem a certeza de que é aquele o grande caso: o corpo que encontram é formado pelos membros de seis vítimas, suturados de modo a formar uma marioneta, que ficou conhecida como ""Boneca de Trapos"". Fawkes é incumbido de identificar as seis vítimas, mas tudo se complica quando a sua ex-mulher, que é repórter, recebe uma carta anónima com fotografias do local do crime, acompanhada de uma lista na qual constam os nomes de seis pessoas e as datas em que o homicida tenciona assassiná-las. O último nome da lista é o de Fawkes. A sentença de morte com data marcada desperta as memórias mais sombrias de Wolf.

Dan Brown,"""Perfeição num best-seller. Um suspense divertidamente erudito, que se delicia levando os leitores numa caçada ofegante e guiando-os através de situações complicadas."" – The New York Times Um assassinato dentro do Museu do Louvre, em Paris, traz à tona uma sinistra conspiração para revelar um segredo que foi protegido por uma sociedade secreta desde os tempos de Jesus Cristo. A vítima é o respeitado curador do museu, Jacques Saunière, um dos líderes dessa antiga fraternidade, o Priorado de Sião, que já teve como membros Leonardo da Vinci, Victor Hugo e Isaac Newton. Momentos antes de morrer, Saunière deixa uma mensagem cifrada que apenas a criptógrafa Sophie Neveu e Robert Langdon, um simbologista, podem desvendar. Eles viram suspeitos e detetives enquanto tentam decifrar um intricado quebra-cabeças que pode lhes revelar um segredo milenar que envolve a Igreja Católica. Apenas alguns passos à frente das autoridades e do perigoso assassino, Sophie e Robert vão à procura de pistas ocultas nas obras de Da Vinci e se debruçam sobre alguns dos maiores mistérios da cultura ocidental - da natureza do sorriso da Mona Lisa ao significado do Santo Graal.

Dale Carnegie,"Dale Carnegie cedo percebeu que o êxito tem pouco a ver com conhecimentos profissionais. O mundo pertence a quem consegue expressar as suas ideias, assumir a liderança e entusiasmar os outros. Com base nesta crença, construiu um formidável império na área da formação, hoje presente em 80 países. Como Fazer Amigos e Influenciar Pessoas é o mais bem sucedido livro da história da literatura motivacional. Publicado em 1937, tornou-se num imediato bestseller, esgotou sucessivas edições, foi traduzido em 47 línguas, e ainda hoje vende centenas de milhares de exemplares. O autor sabia que a chave do êxito nas actividades profissionais era o relacionamento pessoal. Com base na sua experiência aperfeiçoou este eficaz método para o sucesso, ainda hoje actual, que começa com as três técnicas fundamentais para lidar com as pessoas, e logo a seguir propõe seis formas de fazer com que os outros gostem de nós, doze maneiras para convencer e nove para liderar.

Colleen McCullough,"Richard Morgan é filho de um taberneiro de Bristol, sensível e instruído, com um dom especial para fabricar mosquetes de pederneira, que a Inglaterra tenciona utilizar contra as suas revoltadas colónias americanas.  
Quando Richard arranja trabalho numa destilaria de rum, a sua eficiência e perspicácia levam-no a encontrar vários canos escondidos, que tem de denunciar, já que desviam ilegalmente 800 galões desta bebida por semana, de modo a fugir aos impostos. É assim que se encontra envolvido numa teia de corrupção que o vai levar a ser aprisionado num dos vários navios de deportados ancorados em Inglaterra e depois noutro, com destino à nova colónia penal que é a Austrália.  
Enquanto Morgan tenta resistir a desastres naturais e às falsidades e subterfúgios dos outros sobreviventes, vemos formar-se diante dos nossos olhos um microcosmos da audaciosa sociedade em que a Austrália se haveria de transformar.  
A investigação brilhante e exaustivamente realizada a todos os pormenores da época que serve de cenário à obra, torna-a memorável e verosímil com a reprodução de mapas, quadros, plantas de navios e outros materiais. A Viagem de Morgan, é pois, um excelente romance de aventuras, com a indomável energia e o ritmo imparável de um filme de acção.

Todas elas se formam em enfermagem, mas cada uma tem as suas próprias ambições. As quatro irmãs Latimer não podiam ser mais próximas, mas cada uma delas tem os seus próprios sonhos: Edda quer ser médica, Tufts quer organizar tudo, a Grace ninguém pode dizer que caminho deve seguir e Kitty quer ser conhecida por outra coisa que não a sua beleza. São famosas na Nova Gales do Sul pela sua beleza e ambição, bem como pelo seu espírito, mas, à medida que se aproximam da maturidade, as perspetivas limitadas da vida que as espera é desmoralizante. Decidem inscrever-se todas juntas numa formação em enfermagem, uma nova opção para as mulheres que até então se tinham visto limitadas ao papel de esposas e mães. As irmãs Latimer irão conhecer novas pessoas e encontrar desafios que em muito contribuirão para o seu amadurecimento e independência. Conhecerão homens de todos os quadrantes sociais, agricultores, colegas no hospital e até homens com cargos públicos e políticos, e cada uma das irmãs terá de avaliar as suas decisões e aquilo que é para si mais importante. O resultado é por vezes feliz, outras arrasador, mas sempre… agridoce.

Clive Cussler,"O Projeto Siciliano é o plano secreto da década. Constitui, ndiscutivelmente, o segredo mais bem guardado desde a bomba atômica. Além disso, é a menina dos olhos do Presidente. Caso venha a obter sucesso, estará criada uma rede de defesa que irá garantir a segurança da América contra qualquer ataque que num futuro previsível possa vir do exterior. A única dificuldade está no fato de que o projeto requerer uma certa quantidade de bizânio, elemento extremamente raro. De fato, parece que todo o bizânio de que se tem notícia no mundo se encontra dentro do Titaníc, afundado em 1912 e que ainda permanece a mais de 3.500 metros de profundidade no Atlântico Norte. A tarefa é bastante simples: resgatar o Titanic! 
O encarregado da missão é Dirk Pitt, homem dos sete instrumentos. Com o emprego de equipamento submergível altamente sofisticado, Pitt põe mãos à obra nesse trabalho hercúleo. A presença de dois espiões russos só pode atrapalhar, o mesmo podendo ser dito de uma certa mulher muito desagradável, o Furacão Amanda. Em compensação, porém, há uma excelente garota que nem de longe se aproxima da idéia, que fazemos de uma arqueóloga oceanográfica. Clive Cussler conseguiu realizar uma notável proeza ao introduzir um aspecto sensacionalista numa história baseada na mais exaustiva pesquisa científica; o Titanic poderia ser içado hoje! A sua novela vai satisfazer o conhecedor da incrível história do transatlântico ordenado, e prenderá a atenção de qualquer um que tenha o gosto da aventura.

Os narradores são cinco pescadores da Cruz Quebrada que trabalham de momento como arrumadores do Lidl.

Neste percurso, Ana Maria descobre que no século XV foi uma das noviças das Agostinhas, conheceu o Judeu Errante e com ele viveu uma bela e trágica história de amor que nunca chegou a cumprir-se.

Determinada, aventureira e apoiada por famílias portuguesas importantes, Ginnie Dennistoun - que escolheria o nome artístico Virginia Montsol - não só venceu todas as barreiras como se tornou uma pequena celebridade no mundo fechado, elitista e masculino dos toiros, arrebatando o público com a sua elegância e beleza.

Aus dieser Haut komme ich nicht mehr heraus.« Das ist das Fazit der Ich-Erzählerin, Ärztin an einem Ostberliner Krankenhaus, kinderlos, geschieden.

Schonungslos und suggestiv erzählt Hein von Einsamkeit und Beziehungslosigkeit in der DDR Anfang der achtziger Jahre. Mit der Novelle Der fremde Freund, die 1982 erschien und im Westen ein Jahr später unter dem Titel Drachenblut herauskam, erlebte Christoph Hein seinen literarischen Durchbruch.

Charles & Mary Lamb,"Shakespeare se tornou o dramaturgo mais conhecido de todos os tempos por várias razões: era genial com as palavras, entendia a alma humana como ninguém e falava de temas universais. Além disso, apresentava seu teatro para todo tipo de gente, conseguindo entreter ao mesmo tempo nobres, artesãos, letrados e analfabetos. No entanto, parte de sua popularidade se deve aos irmãos Charles e Mary Lamb, que, ao adaptarem vinte peças para o formato de conto, tornaram as histórias do autor inglês acessíveis a pessoas de diferentes idades e gêneros, em diversas partes do mundo.Publicados em 1807, os contos dos Lamb eram destinados apenas ao público infantojuvenil e jovens senhoras – para quem as peças originais não eram recomendadas devido à dificuldade da língua e ao teor erótico –, mas agradaram também aos adultos e alcançaram enorme sucesso. Com o apogeu do império britânico, a coletânea atravessou os mares, chegou aos quatro cantos do globo e ganhou versões em chinês, japonês, hindi e em muitas outras línguas. Foi assim, por exemplo, que o Oriente entrou em contato com as peças do bardo.Charles (1775-1834) e Mary (1764-1847) eram profundos conhecedores da obra de Shakespeare e acreditavam que a leitura deveria levar o jovem a sonhar, e não apenas incentivar as boas maneiras e os princípios elevados, como ensinavam os textos infantojuvenis da época. Charles adaptou seis peças – O rei Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet, Otelo, Romeu e Julietae Timão de Atenas –, enquanto Mary cuidou dos textos restantes. Na primeira edição, apenas o nome de Charles apareceu na capa, apesar de os amigos saberem que Mary tinha feito a maior parte do trabalho.No Brasil, o livro dos irmãos Lamb só chegou em 1920. Em 1943, a então Editora Globo de Porto Alegre (depois Globo Livros) publicou pela primeira vez a tradução irretocável de Mario Quintana, que nunca deixou de ser reeditada, passando apenas por atualizações ortográficas.Até hoje, a coletânea Contos de Shakespeare é reconhecida como uma excelente introdução ao teatro shakespeariano para o público geral. Agora, a nova edição deste clássico ganhou ilustrações de Weberson Santiago, nova capa, novo projeto gráfico, prefácio inédito e texto de orelha de John Milton, especialista em Shakespeare, professor titular em Estudos da Tradução da USP.Os vinte contos do livro:A tempestadeSonho de uma noite de verãoConto de invernoMuito barulho por nadaComo lhes aprouverOs dois cavalheiros de VeronaO mercador de VenezaCimbelinoO rei LearMacbethTudo está bem quando acaba bemA megera domadaA comédia dos errosOlho por olhoNoite de reisTimão de AtenasRomeu e JulietaHamlet, o príncipe da dinamarcaOteloPéricles, príncipe de Tiro",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Charles\Contos de Shakespeare (2774)\cover.jpg,9788525055880,2013-11-13T12:33:17+00:00,Globo Livros,3,,1.0,"Fiction, Classics",Contos de Shakespeare,2774
Cherry Mosteshar,"Cherry Mosteshar nasceu no seio de uma abastada família iraniana. Embora tenha nascido no Irão, foi educada no Ocidente, tendo estudado em Oxford. Quando, já como jornalista, regressa ao seu país natal como correspondente para a imprensa britânica, encontra uma realidade bem diferente da que esperava. O Irão da era pós-revolucionária vai abalar as suas crenças e o seu futuro, vai chocá-la de um modo irreversível.  
Nesse Irão “moderno”, Cherry encontra a única realidade a que as mulheres islâmicas têm direito: uma realidade despida de opções e humanidade, na qual ela, como todas as mulheres, não tem qualquer estatuto de valor.  
É durante a elaboração das suas reportagens sobre o governo iraniano que Cherry começa a questionar abertamente as leis islâmicas. Sob ameaça de prisão e considerando a hipótese de regressar ao Ocidente, Cherry conhece um homem iraniano cuja sensibilidade e fé lhe permite recuperar uma tradição que julgara ter perdido para sempre. Ele parecia, de facto, estar do seu lado... Será apenas após o casamento que Cherry virá a descobrir a verdadeira e terrível natureza desse homem; e, num país onde os homens podem tudo, isso será, por si só, uma ameaça constante. 
Este relato vívido, duro e apaixonado é o fruto dessa experiência, e retrata sem pudor o quadro chocante da opressão feminina nos países islâmicos onde o Corão é usado como uma arma legitimadora da opressão e da violência sobre as mulheres.

Charles Dickens,"Redlaw era um homem velho e amargurado que vivia numa velha casa triste e solitária. Professor de química, de renome, dava a impressão, no entanto, de que nada o satisfazia. E as pessoas diziam coisas a seu respeito; entre outras, que andava um espectro a persegui-lo. Nunca ninguém vira esse espectro, mas todos concordavam que Redlaw não possuía a felicidade. Só o próprio Redlaw conhecia, contudo, as razões do sofrimento: na juventude, a noiva fugira-lhe com o seu maior amigo, o qual, por sua vez, abandonara a sua única irmã, que o amava. Redlaw vira, depois, morrer a irmã e ficara sozinho, acompanhado apenas pelas recordações que o torturavam. Na noite de Natal, porém, o espectro aparece a Redlaw e conversam longamente discutindo o passado e os desgostos e o espectro faz dádiva a Redlaw de um dom: o de esquecer, totalmente, o que lhe aconteceu antes, dom que poderá estender a todas as pessoas em que tocar. E Redlaw encontra os habitantes do pequeno mundo em que se move: a pobre família Tetterby, o estudante Edmundo Denham, o vagabundo George Swidgers... E acontecem as reacções mais estranhas. Charles Dickens, mestre de romancistas e um dos escritores ingleses mais importantes de sempre, recria, para nós, um universo especialíssimo e inesquecível, marcado por um fundo humanismo. O que é preferível: uma existência sem recordações ou a realidade dura, mas autêntica, de uma personalidade para cuja formação concorrem, inevitavelmente, a Alegria e a Dor?

Carlos Ruiz Zafón,"O protagonista e narrador de O jogo do anjo é David Martín, um jovem escritor que vive em Barcelona na década de 1920. Aos 28 anos, desiludido no amor e na vida profissional e gravemente doente, o escritor vive sozinho num casarão em ruínas. É quando surge Andreas Corelli, um estrangeiro que se diz editor de livros. Ele promete a David muito dinheiro, e sua simples aparição parece devolver a saúde ao escritor. Contudo, o que ele pede em troca não é pouco. E o preço real dessa encomenda é o que David precisará descobrir. Embora O jogo do anjo traga alguns dos personagens de A Sombra do Vento, de acordo com o autor, o livro não é uma continuação de sua obra anterior, mas sim uma segunda investida em uma narrativa “centrada em um mesmo universo literário”. Zafón diz que pretende construir uma tetralogia e que as histórias de todos os volumes se situarão em algum período entre a Revolução Industrial e o final da Segunda Guerra Mundial: “A Sombra do Vento abrange a primeira metade do século XX, e um pouco mais. O jogo do anjo faz referência a acontecimentos que vão de 1904 a 1945.” No entanto, nenhuma delas será continuação da outra.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Carlos Ruiz Zafon\O jogo do anjo (2787)\cover.jpg,9788581050942,2008-10-09T14:00:49+01:00,Companhia das Letras,4,El cementerio de los libros olvidados,2.0,"Fiction, Historical, General, Mystery, Fantasy, Romance",O jogo do anjo,2787

Carlos de Oliveira,"[Uma Abelha na Chuva](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2161963.Uma_Abelha_na_Chuva ""Uma Abelha na Chuva"") conta-nos as peripécias de Álvaro Rodrigues Silvestre, sujeito às “instigações” de sua esposa, D. Maria dos Prazeres Pessoa de Alva Sancho Silvestre. O livro começa com uma confissão de Álvaro e com a sua vontade de a tornar pública na primeira página da Comarca — uma redenção consigo próprio. 
Esta história leva-nos à aldeia de Montouro num Outono chuvoso, onde conhecemos as personagens que rodeiam este casal e constituem a aldeia e pelos quais ficamos a conhecer o Portugal provinciano de meados do século XX. 
Como afirma o autor, “Por onde a solidão a fazia resvalar. E o quarto tão frio. Talvez os ventos, os granizos do norte, as grandes chuvas. Talvez D. Violante. Mas sobretudo a velha casa de Alva, quando a miséria não chegara ainda e, atrás dela, os Silvestres. Agora é o marido labrego e doentio, as bebedeiras, o desencanto, isto. Quer melhores nortadas, D. Violante?”. 
O escritor ironiza a sabedoria popular, o largo da aldeia quando acolhe um ajuntamento popular, ancestral, onde tudo se discute, onde tudo se decide num julgamento popular e, tantas vezes, tacanho. E a morte, que persegue Álvaro numa bebedeira de brandy, a morte que tolhe Jacinto e Clara, à chuva, persiste em vingar neste livro.

Carl Safina,"«Para Além das Palavras é um livro que terá um impacto enorme em muitos leitores, pelo modo como impulsiona a nossa relação com os animais para um plano mais elevado… A par de A Origem das Espécies de Darwin, e O Gene Egoísta de Dawkins, Para Além das Palavras é um marco essencial para entendermos o nosso lugar na natureza. Tem, de facto, potencial para alterar o modo como nos relacionamos com o mundo natural.» [The New York Review of Books] «Um novo grupo de golfinhos, onde inúmeras crias nadavam ao lado das mães, emergiu ao longo da nossa embarcação, saltando e chapinhando, chamando por nós de forma misteriosa com o seu assobio característico. Queria saber o que eles estavam a sentir, e porque nos parecem seres tão atraentes, tão… próximos. Mas desta vez permiti-me apresentar-lhes a pergunta proibida: “quem são vocês?” Durante décadas de observação de campo, Carl Safina fez importantes descobertas sobre o cérebro dos animais. Agora o autor oferece-nos uma visão intima do seu comportamento, desafiando os preconceitos que teimam em separar o comportamento humano do animal. Neste livro o leitor irá viajar até ao Parque Nacional de Amboseli, situado em plena paisagem protegida do Quénia, onde poderá observar como as famílias de elefantes sobrevivem à caça furtiva e às secas; irá depois ao Parque Nacional de Yellowstone observar o modo como os lobos se organizam após a morte de uma alcateia; visitará finalmente as águas cristalinas do Nordeste Pacífico para observar a fascinante e silenciosa sociedade das baleias assassinas. Para Além das Palavras é uma análise sobre as personalidades únicas dos animais, desvendadas através de histórias de alegria, tristeza, ciúme e amor animal. Um livro que nos ensina que as semelhanças entre a consciência humana e animal deveriam ser motivo mais do que suficiente para reavaliarmos o modo como interagimos com os animais.

Mas sinto-me sorrir de ver esse sorriso  
Que me penetra bem, como este sol de inverno. 
Passo contigo a tarde e sempre sem receio  
Da luz crepuscular, que enerva, que provoca.  
Eu não demoro o olhar na curva do teu seio  
Nem me lembrei jamais de te beijar na boca. 
Eu não sei se é amor. Será talvez começo…  
Eu não sei que mudança a minha alma pressente…  
Amor não sei se o é, mas sei que te estremeço,  
Que adoecia talvez de te saber doente.

Devia ser um momento assombroso. 
Mas este plano, segundo o que me observou o doutor, era de execução dificílima. Para ler toda a história do futuro, seria mister um sono hipnótico de muitos meses ou de muitos anos, e à dificuldade acresceria o perigo. 
Tive que modificar a minha ambição: 
— Visto que em poucas horas não é possível fazer a revista dos séculos, como se faz a revista do ano para os teatros de terceira ordem, desejo, senhor conde, que por duas ou três horas a sugestão me transporte ao ano Três Mil, e que me coloque no ponto mais civilizado do mundo de então, podendo eu saber se ainda haverá memória do meu país e o que dele se pensa. 
— Far-se-á o que deseja, — rematou o hipnotizador. — 
E, sem pronunciar uma palavra mais, sentou-se defronte de mim, tocando nos meus joelhos com os dele. Abriu as mãos e espalmou-mas nas regiões temporais, obrigando-me a fixar os olhos no seu olhar, vivo, penetrante e ao mesmo tempo imóvel.

Camilo Castelo Branco,"Camilo Castelo Branco (1825-1890) foi um escritor portugués, considerado o criador da novela passional portuguesa. Escreveu irreverentes crônicas para jornais. Nasceu na freguesia dos Mártires, em Lisboa, Portugal, ficou órfão de mãe com um ano e de pai com 10 anos. Foi morar com uma tia e depois com sua irmã mais velha. Em 1841, com apenas 16 anos, casou-se com uma jovem de 15 anos, Joaquina Pereira, mas logo a abandonou. Em 1843 ingressou na Escola Médico-Cirúrgica na cidade do Porto, mas entregue à boemia, não conseguiu concluir o curso. Em 1845 publicou seus primeiros trabalhos literários. Em 1846 fugiu com a jovem Patrícia Emília, mas a abandona, poucos anos depois. No ano seguinte morreu sua esposa legítima, de quem estava separado, e a filha do casal morreu no ano seguinte. Camilo Castelo Branco passou por uma crise espiritual em 1850, e ingressou no seminário do Porto, pretendendo seguir a vida religiosa. Nesse ano conheceu Ana Plácido, que casada com um comerciante brasileiro, abandonou o marido em 1859 e foi viver com Camilo. Em 1860 é processado e preso por crime de adultério, mas é absolvido no ano seguinte, passando a viver com Ana. O casal foi morar em Lisboa e depois em São Miguel de Seide, sempre com muitos problemas financeiros. Em 1863 publica ""Amor de Perdição"", sua novela mais famosa. Sua vida atribulada lhe deu inspiração para os temas de suas novelas. Também reconstituiu em suas obras o panorama dos costumes de Portugal de seu tempo, quase sempre com uma profunda sintonia com as maneiras de ser e sentir do povo português. Em 1889, quando se torna uma celebridade nacional como escritor, recebe uma homenagem da Academia de Lisboa. Recebeu o título de Visconde concedido pelo rei de Portugal, D. Luís I. Uma doença nos olhos que pouco a pouco lhe tirava a visão, fez Camilo mergulhar em profunda depressão. Depois de saber que ficaria definitivamente cego Camilo suicida-se em São Miguel de Seide, Vila Nova de Famalicão, no dia 01 de junho de 1890.

A primavera, há cem anos, aparecia quando o calendário a dava. Ninguém saía de sua casa às cinco horas duma tarde cálida de maio, com um casaco de reserva no braço para resistir ao frio das sete horas; nem o peralta portuense levava escondido na copa do chapéu o cache-nez, com que, ao anoitecer, havia de resguardar as orelhas da nortada cortante.O globo, naquele tempo, movia-se em volta do sol com a regularidade assinalada pelos astrónomos.

Quem, à face da folhinha, se vestisse de fresco em maio, podia sair à rua trajado de holandilha ou vareja, que não entraria em casa a espirrar constipado pela súbita frialdade que o surpreendeu.

Camilo Castelo Branco,"&quot;Estive intentado a interpor nesta segunda edição da Doida do Candal uns discursos acerca do duelo, como quem inculca tendências a desbravar o género humano de tão brutal selvageria. Nesse campo de mortos infamados e já também chorados, acharia eu que farte tristíssimas flores com que aformosear tragédias. Não o há tão abundante para lágrimas e dadivoso às menos inspiradas fantasias. Dei, todavia, de mão ao intento, quando o meu editor e amigo me disse que A Bruxa de Monte Córdova era menos lida que A Doida do Candal. Entrei a comparar os dois romances para entender a desigualdade dos méritos, e vim ao convencimento de que um pouquinho mais de filosofia estragara a Bruxa. Nada, pois, de tirar à novela a inutilidade que a faz preciosa. Seja cada um do seu tempo e do seu país.

Camilo Castelo Branco,"«A viúva de Domingos Leite e de João da Veiga Cabral já não tinha alma sensível às felicidades convencionais desta vida. Recordações que lhe eram afronta, e saudades atormentadoras – a imagem terrível do primeiro marido, e a imagem amada e deplorativa do segundo – fechavam-lhe em nuvem negra qualquer aurora de esperançoso contentamento. Nem as carícias de Ângela, nem os amoráveis rogos de Francisco Mendes a demoveram de seguir o destino que a norteara a Portugal. O ermo, a soledade, a dor sem distração, morrer, enfim, alheia de amparos que suavizam o transe, era para Maria Isabel uma necessidade do coração, um sacrifício voluntário à redenção de suas culpas para com Domingos Leite, e ao seu imenso amor a João da Veiga Cabral. No entanto, se algum desafogo sentia ao cuidar que suas lágrimas eram vistas desde o seio de eternidade, com certeza não eram os olhos do primeiro marido os que lhe davam a recompensa da imolação.» **

Na altura, o mistério deixou a polícia perplexa: o que poderia levar os pais a abandonarem uma bebé? Teriam sido raptados? Assassinados? Apesar dos esforços das autoridades locais não foi encontrado rasto da família nem qualquer explicação plausível para o sucedido.

Mas o seu envolvimento num caso de homicídio, leva-o de novo à presença do vigário-geral e a uma nova missão.

Thomas Cromwell, o temido vigário-geral de Henrique VIII, lança uma campanha contra a velha Igreja, com novas e selvagens leis, julgamentos arbitrários e uma vasta rede de informadores. Ana Bolena foi decapitada e os mosteiros estão a ser extintos – os seus tesouros pilhados e as suas terras alvo da ganância dos cortesãos e da nobreza rural. Mas embora tenha abafado uma revolta popular, Thomas Cromwell receia que novas insurreições destruam o reino. Quando um dos seus comissários é assassinado num mosteiro, em Scarnsea, a costa sul de Inglaterra, Cromwell convoca Matthew Shardlake, um advogado conhecido como “o corcunda mais perspicaz dos tribunais de Inglaterra”, para liderar a investigação. Quando Shardlake e o seu jovem assistente e protegido Mark Poer chegam a Scarnsea, descobrem provas de conduta sexual imprópria, desvio de fundos e traição. A descoberta de dois assassinatos leva Shardlake a agir depressa para impedir o assassino de voltar a matar.

Bruno de Carvalho,"Bruno de Carvalho é uma das figuras incontornáveis dos anos recentes do desporto e do futebol em Portugal: entrou como um furacão, desafiando o statu quo; conseguiu o impensável, como contratar o treinador do campeão em título; devolveu esperança aos sócios e adeptos do Sporting - e chegou até a ter uma votação superior a 90%. Mas, pouco tempo depois, em meses, passou do céu ao inferno, tendo sido destituído e suspenso da condição de sócio do seu clube de sempre. Ao longo dos cinco anos e meio que esteve à frente do Sporting Clube de Portugal, Bruno de Carvalho foi tido sempre como um homem frontal, determinado e controverso. Mas nunca revelou nada do que conta neste livro. Sem Filtro revela, pela primeira vez, as histórias de bastidores de uma era recheada de episódios - uns difíceis, outros caricatos - com treinadores (como Jorge Jesus e Marco Silva), com jogadores (como Rui Patrício e William Carvalho), com empresários (como Jorge Mendes e Nélio Lucas), com a banca (nomeadamente BES e Millennium BCP), com figuras históricas do Sporting (como José Maria Ricciardi e os elementos do Grupo Stromp), sem esquecer o ataque à equipa na Academia de Alcochete e a gestão das direções e administrações anteriores.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Bruno de Carvalho\Sem Filtro_ AS HISTORIAS DOS BASTID (2833)\cover.jpg,9789896662172,2019-02-15T13:30:30+00:00,Contraponto,3,,1.0,Autores Portugueses,Sem Filtro: AS HISTÓRIAS DOS BASTIDORES DA MINHA PRESIDÊNCIA,2833

Boris Akunin,"Boris Akunin é, no momento, um dos nomes mais sonantes da literatura policial, com a série protagonizada pelo detective Erast Fandorin. Neste romance, passado em 1877, Fandorin vê-se envolvido num conflito que opõe a Rússia czarista ao Império Otomano, mas que acaba praticamente por atingir todos os países da Europa. Por entre o perigo e a devastação instalados no território, o detective conhece Varia uma jovem que arrisca a vida atravessando a Rússia, a caminho da frente de batalha, para se encontrar com o seu noivo, Petia Ialdokov, acusado de espionagem. Convictos da inocência de Petia, Fandorin e Varia seguem no encalço do verdadeiro traidor, que planeia sabotar o avanço russo sobre Constantinopla, e a eles junta-se ainda uma galeria variada de figuras que vem completar este emocionante e elaborado enredo, dando forma e vida a uma Rússia dos finais do século XIX. Jogada de Mestre é um policial extremamente bem escrito, inteligente e que prima pela originalidade, na medida em que nos obriga a deslindar todo um complexo esquema de espionagem, montado a partir das movimentações políticas da época.

Uma fuga de uma prisão de segurança máxima. Chamadas desesperadas do FBI. O pior pesadelo da Agente Especial Riley Paige tornou-se realidade: um assassino em série que prendeu há anos fugiu da prisão. E o alvo principal é ela. Riley está habituada a ser ela a caçar, mas pela primeira vez, encontra-se numa situação – e a família – em que alguém a persegue. Enquanto a assedia, o assassino inicia um ciclo de homicídios e Riley tem que o parar antes que seja tarde demais – para as outras vítimas e para si própria. Mas este não é um assassino qualquer. Ele é demasiado inteligente e o seu jogo do rato e do gato demasiado doentio, conseguindo estar sempre um passo à frente de Riley. Desesperada para o parar, Riley compreende que apenas há uma forma de o conseguir: mergulhar no passado e analisar a mente doentia do assassino, as vítimas do passado e abarcar o que o motiva. Riley percebe que a única forma de o parar é enfrentando a escuridão que julgava já ter esquecido.

Estão a aparecer mulheres mortas numa extensão solitária de uma autoestrada no Delaware. Algumas desaparecem durante muito tempo e outras aparecem mortas, sendo os corpos exibidos de formas estranhas e misteriosas. Quando é detetado um padrão, torna-se óbvio para o FBI que um assassino em série está à solta – atraindo mulheres em esquemas duvidosos – e que nunca parará de matar. Desesperado para resolver o caso, o FBI pede a ajuda da Agente Especial Riley Paige. Mas a brilhante Riley, ainda a recuperar de casos recentes, encontrou finalmente a paz na sua vida familiar e está determinada a ajudar a filha April a reerguer-se.

A caçada de Riley leva-a até ao âmago do perturbador mundo de caroneiros, de pessoas à deriva, de mulheres a quem ninguém dá qualquer importância. Quando descobre que várias mulheres são mantidas vivas e que há tempo para as salvar, Riley sabe que nada a impedirá de ir até ao limite num caso que a obceca. Entretanto a sua vida parece colapsar e a sua mente frágil mal consegue aguentar a pressão.

Bernard Cornwell,"«Bernard Cornwell, no decorrer de uma investigação para o segundo volume da série Em Demanda da Relíquia, encontra mencionado a existência de um investigador mandatado pela realeza para descobrir da veracidade dos factos dos condenados à forca. Esta nota foi suficiente para transportar a sua mente fértil a este novo romance onde introduz o investigador como um ‘detective privado’.  
E o leitor é levado à Inglaterra do século XIX. Corre o ano de 1817 e Old Bailey é uma das ruas mais movimentadas de Londres, porque é ali, diante da prisão de Newgate, que multidões acorrem para assistir à derradeira agonia de homens e mulheres condenados à forca.  
A Charles Corday, um pintor retratista, restam apenas sete dias de vida. Foi condenado pelo assassínio de uma condessa cujo retrato andava a pintar. A sentença foi a de morte pela forca.  
Mas, por motivos de ordem política, o Ministério do Interior achou necessário confirmar a sua culpabilidade. Assim, encarregou da investigação do caso um tal Rider Sandman, que, porém, não dispunha de quaisquer habilitações especiais para o efeito. Tratava-se de um jovem militar que se destacara na batalha de Waterloo e granjeara também fama pelo seu talento como jogador de críquete, mas cuja vida andava então pelas ruas da amargura. A proposta de um emprego temporário, bem remunerado e pouco exigente, surgiu-lhe como caída dos céus.  
Porém, quando Rider Sandman inicia a sua pesquisa, deambulando entre os fétidos cárceres de Newgate e os perfumados salões da aristocracia, apercebe-se de que muitos dados não se coadunam com o veredicto, e também de que há demasiada gente empenhada em travar-lhe o passo.  
Sandman é um perito nas artes da guerra, e, para além disso, conta com o apoio de poderosos, embora algo extravagantes, aliados. Mas enfrenta uma cabala dirigida pelos mais ricos e impiedosos senhores da Regência inglesa. 
Sandman apenas dispõe de sete dias para salvar um homem inocente do patíbulo mais voraz da Europa. O carrasco aguarda a sua hora. É uma corrida contra o fatal nó escorregadio.»

Sua obra é singular e eclética em termo de tendências: recebe influências do parnasianismo, do decadentismo e do simbolismo. Entre as principais características temos o uso da linguagem científica e de temas ligados à materialidade da morte, como a putrefação, a decomposição da matéria.

Sabe vagamente que tem umas tarefas a cumprir - uma última, sobretudo: encontrar-se com um ilustre poeta desaparecido que, como todos os fantasmas, talvez apareça só à meia-noite. Entrega-se ao fluxo do acaso, segundo a lógica das livres associações do inconsciente, e dá consigo a cumprir um percurso que o leva a reviver aquilo que foi, a tentar desatar os nós cegos da sua vida passada que nunca conseguiu compreender. A alucinação, a errância, o sonho duram doze horas, nas quais o tempo de uma vida se comprime e se dilata: passado e presente confundem-se e os vivos encontram-se com os mortos no mesmo plano.

Sozinho, ou com Maria José de Lancastre, traduziu para italiano a obra de Fernando Pessoa. Considerando que a sua pátria é também a língua portuguesa, escreveu um romance em português, Requiem, 1991.

Antonio Tabucchi,"Uma conjectura do autor é a de que este livro poderia servir de guia a um amante de viagens absurdas. E não deixa de ser absurda esta busca de um amigo que desapareceu, sombra que pertence a um passado também ele conjectural, numa Índia que se conhece quase só através de quartos de hotel, de hospitais, de estações de caminho-de-ferro. Uma Índia que todavia transparece em conversas com profetas nómadas, Jesuítas portugueses, prostitutas de Bombaim, uma repórter que fotografa a miséria de Calcutá. Mas este misterioso ballet de sombras é sobretudo um hino às faculdades criativas da linguagem, pois é graças a uma palavra evocada em várias línguas que o viajante se aproxima daquele que procura. E é graças à escrita que esta viagem se transforma em livro, passa da insónia ao sonho e do sonho ao texto.

Esforço inútil. Tudo é ilusão.  
Quantos não cismam nisso mesmo a esta hora  
Com uma taça, ou um punhal na mão! 
Mas a Arte, o Lar, um filho, António? Embora!  
Quimeras, sonhos, bolas de sabão.  
E a tortura do Além e quem lá mora!  
Isso é, talvez, minha única aflição. 
Toda a dor pode suportar-se, toda!  
Mesmo a da noiva morta em plena boda,  
Que por mortalha leva… essa que traz. 
Mas uma não: é a dor do pensamento!  
Ai quem me dera entrar nesse convento  
Que há além da Morte e que se chama A Paz!

António Lobo Antunes,"Este quarto livro de crónicas de António Lobo Antunes é uma selecção de 79 crónicas publicadas na revista Visão. Nestes pequenos textos, António Lobo Antunes evoca lugares, personagens, retratos do quotidiano e memórias de infância. Não morreste na cama mas morreste entre lençóis de metal horrivelmente amachucados na auto-estrada de Cascais para Lisboa e a gente ali, diante do teu caixão, tão tristes. Começa assim a quarta crónica deste livro e é um bom exemplo da intensidade dramática de alguns textos que sendo muito mais acessíveis ao público do que os seus romances não descuram uma forte componente literária. E com uma narrativa que nos surpreende sempre pela genialidade como junta as palavras para formar cada frase, António Lobo Antunes leva-nos da tristeza à alegria e arranca-nos sorrisos pela forma como se ri de si próprio e das pequenas fraquezas de cada um de nós e que ""apanha"" e retrata como ninguém.

Ouvimos os dramas de cada um dos filhos - Beatriz, que passou por dois casamentos infelizes; Francisco, um homem rancoroso que pretende tomar à força os bens que restaram; Ana, que se perdeu nas drogas; João, homossexual perseguido pela intolerância; e Rita, morta muito jovem com um câncer fulminante. Ouvimos também a voz da matriarca, do pai e de Mercília, antiga empregada da família que também tem seus segredos.

António José Da Silva,"[http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/obra...](http://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/obras-diabinho-da-mao-furada/)
A caminho de casa, depois de campanhas de guerra, o soldado Peralta, para fugir da chuva e do frio, vê-se obrigado a pernoitar numa casa em ruínas de uma aldeia abandonada. Ali encontra um demónio travesso que decide acompanhá-lo na sua jornada, atormentando todos aqueles que Peralta encontra no caminho. 
Uns chamam-me Diabinho da Mão Furada e outros Fradinho, por termos alguns de nós as mãos tão rotas de liberdades, que em muitas casas onde andamos fazemos ferver o mel, crescer o azeite, aumentarem-se os bens, lograrem-se felicidades, e sobretudo, quando nos merecem com boa companhia que nos fazem, descobrimos tesouros escondidos aos donos das casas em que andamos  
Escrita durante os inícios do século XVIII (1700) esta novela tem a particularidade de ser considerada a primeira novela de “terror” portuguesa, apesar de conter também muitos elementos cómicos. 
Sendo de autoria anónima, a obra tem levantado uma ampla discussão em torno da identidade do seu autor a partir do momento em que o seu manuscrito (ou uma cópia do original) foi descoberto no século seguinte. Mesmo quando se levantou a presunção de ter sido uma obra da autoria de António José da Silva – mais conhecido pelo cognome “o Judeu” e que viria a morrer nas fogueiras da inquisição – esta não foi consensual. No entanto acabou por publicada em 1861, pela primeira vez, com o título e o subtítulo de “Obras do Diabinho da Mão Furada – uma novela Diabólica de António José da Silva”, o que ajudou à sua divulgação pois na época a sociedade fazia uma reflexão sobre as injustiças da inquisição (que se extinguiu, oficialmente só em 1821) e António José da Silva era visto como um dos mais notórios mártires desse tempo. Fosse ou não o autor, o seu nome acabou por ficar associado à obra. 
Não é possível dizer em que termos a obra foi divulgada na época que foi escrita, se é que o chegou realmente a ser. Teria sido vendida sob a forma de folhetins? Teria sido narrada em salões de convívio da nobreza ou da burguesia, como era costume? Ou em botequins (bares da época) a ouvintes dispostos a ouvir? Não é possível sabê-lo. Mas a obra certamente foi escrita com o intuito de aterrorizar e de divertir quem a lesse ou ouvisse e faz um retrato perfeito e mordaz da mentalidade e dos costumes da época em que foi escrita. É uma aventura que descreve uma caminhada do Alentejo a Lisboa, cheia de peripécia e com elementos que claramente invocam a obra de Dante Alighieri, “A Divina Comédia” que tanto servem para aterrorizar, moralizar e para divertir através do sarcasmo e da paródia. 
Será pertinente falar também do “demónio” que a obra invoca: O Diabinho da Mão Furada. O nome original deste personagem, e pelo qual ainda é conhecido nalguns locais do Norte de Portugal, é Duende da Mão Furada – uma criatura folclórica galaico-portuguesa que remota ao tempo dos celtiberos. É um duende caseiro e que tanto concede favores e benefícios como engana e prega partidas. Tem na cabeça um barrete encarnado, faz desaparecer peças de roupa ou outros objetos da casa e faz azedar a comida que acabou de ser feita; mas também é capaz de trazer a paz e a felicidade ao lar se o mantiverem satisfeito. Para isso basta deixarem-lhe migas de pão ensopadas em leite num prato, durante a noite, em qualquer canto da casa. Se está de muito mau humor entra nos quartos, durante a noite, através do buraco da fechadura das portas, põe-se à vontade em cima das pessoas e causa-lhes grandes pesadelos. Tem as mãos furadas porque são mãos “cheias de enganos” e não se pode confiar nele, mas que também o faz derrubar muitos dos objetos domésticos que por vezes tenta roubar. Durante os séculos XVII e XVIII – séculos de forte domínio católico que abarcou praticamente tudo ligado ao paganismo – o duende das mãos furadas assumiu a forma de um diabrete e passou a chamar-se de Diabinho da Mão Furada ou Fradinho da Mão Furada; um ser malévolo e ligado aos medos dos infernos mas que manteve a personalidade brincalhona e sempre disposto a pregar partidas. 
Nota: Para além de uma atualização ortográfica, a presente edição foi alvo de uma adaptação linguística corrente, nomeadamente, em passagens em que se verificou que linguagem usada no século XVIII dificultava, em grande escala, a leitura da obra. Tal trabalho foi realizado pela equipa do Luso Livros tendo o cuidado de preservar o estilo literário do manuscrito original.

António Coelho Lousada,"A história de uma lenda. Uma lenda envolta em factos históricos e que nos conta como os habitantes do Porto ganharam a alcunha de “tripeiros”. 
Corria o ano de 1384. O Reino de Castela, aproveitando a disputas pelo trono português deixadas com a morte de D. Fernando I, invade Portugal tomando de assalto as cidades mais importantes do país: Lisboa, Porto e Coimbra. Sitiadas as cidades e isoladas umas das outras, coube aos cidadãos arranjarem meios de lutar com os seus próprios meios e sem contar com a ajuda externa. 
Foi a cidade do Porto a primeira a conseguir livrar-se dos invasores, fazendo jus ao cognome que séculos depois lhe atribuíram e que D. Maria II ratificou: a Cidade Invicta, ou seja, a não conquistada, devido aos múltiplos feitos valorosos dos seus habitantes que sempre souberam resistir aos invasores, fossem eles espanhóis, franceses e ingleses; e de ser sempre o último bastião de protecção do reino em guerras civis. 
Lisboa, por seu lado, onde as forças das armadas de Castela se concentraram mais, teve mais dificuldade em repelir os castelhanos e permaneceu sitiada durante vários meses, vendo a sua população a sucumbir pela fome e pela peste. Vindo em auxilio dos lisboetas vieram então várias galés do Porto, com soldados e mantimentos para repelir o invasor e dar de comer a uma população a morrer de fome. 
Salvou-se assim a população de Lisboa graças à valentia ao sacrifício dos portuenses que deram toda a carne que restava nos armazéns da cidade do Porto, guardando para si, engenhosamente, os “miúdos” dos animais, ou seja: os orgãos e as tripas; geralmente deitados fora.

Anton Chekhov,"""Ainda que alheio a uma mensagem social ou ética directa, o génio de Tchékhov desvendou mais aspectos tenebrosos da Rússia camponesa faminta, desorientada, escrava, malfadada, do que o grande número de otros escritores, do género de Górki, em cujos livros são apresentadas ideias sociais em forma de marionetas pintadas. Digo mais: uma pessoa que prefira Dostoiévski ou Górki a Tchékhov nunca chegará a compreender a essência da literatura russa e da vida russa, e, o que é ainda mais importante, a essência literária em geral.

Anton Pavlovich Tchekhov,"Este livro reúne as quatro principais peças escritas por Anton Tchékhov, traduzidas do russo por Nina Guerra e Filipe Guerra.  
 *A Gaivota* foi publicada em 1896, e nela é já perceptível o modo de ser das personagens tchékhovianas.  
 *O Tio Vânia* foi escrito entre 1896 e 1897, logo a seguir a *A Gaivota* e ainda antes de esta estrear. Foi representada pela primeira vez no Teatro de Arte de Moscovo, em Outubro de 1899.  
 *Três Irmãs* , peça publicada em 1901, é talvez o ponto culminante da dramaturgia de Tchékhov. É a história de três mulheres unidas num só destino, descrito em diálogos vagos e veementes. São três irmãs envolvidas na intolerável sensação de que a vida está noutro lado. Três vidas que procuram escapar aos constrangimentos que a educação, a família e uma cidade de província sobre elas exercem.  
 *O Ginjal* estreou a 17 de Janeiro de 1904, ou seja, no dia em que Tchékhov fazia 44 anos. Cerca de um ano antes dissera a Olga Knippver a peça há tanto tempo prometida.

Quando Henrietta morre, Louise e Carlo são enviados para Londres como presente para o rei em sofrimento. Chegados a um país de costumes pouco refinados, cujo rei rapidamente se dispõe a seduzir Louise custe o que custar, torna-se claro para ambos que as suas únicas armas serão uma boa dose de diplomacia e quantidades extravagantes de gelo.

Anthony Burgess & Giovanna Cianelli & Fabio Fernandes,"Uma das mais brilhantes sátiras distópicas já escritas, Laranja Mecânica ganhou fama ao ser adaptado em uma obra magistral do cinema pelas mãos de Stanley Kubrick. O livro, entretanto, também é um clássico moderno da ficção inglesa e um marco na cultura pop, que ao lado de 1984, de George Orwell, Admirável Mundo Novo, de Aldous Huxley, e Fahrenheit 451, de Ray Bradbury, representa um dos ícones literários da alienação pós-industrial. Alex é o jovem líder de uma gangue de adolescentes cuja diversão é cometer perversidades e atos de violência pelas ruas de uma cidade futurista governada por um Estado repressivo e totalitário. Depois de cometer um crime que termina em um assassinato, ele acaba preso pelo governo e submetido a um método experimental de recondicionamento de mentes criminosas, que se utiliza de terapia de aversão brutal. Brilhante, transgressivo e influente, o livro traz uma visão assombrosa do futuro contada em seu próprio léxico inventivo chamado “nadsat”, que mescla gírias de gangues inglesas e palavras russas. O filme homônimo de Stanley Kubrick teve como base as primeiras edições americanas deste livro, que por conta da insistência dos editores americanos, tiveram o capítulo final suprimido, acreditando que um final sem redenção para Alex seria mais realista. Esta edição, entretanto, mantém o capítulo final original.

XVI, querendo daí tirar ilações para um futuro diferente. Se hoje o autor pudesse voltar a discorrer sobre o tema, o título da sua conferência seria o mesmo com uma ligeira diferença: Causas da Decadência de Portugal nos últimos 4 séculos e meio, pois 139 anos passaram desde então e, pelos menos em Portugal, continuamos a sentir que nem os nossos representantes têm força mobilizadora, séria e construtiva para reerguer o país nem o povo tem vontade de mudar a sua mentalidade fatalista, deixar de encolher os ombros e construir um Portugal ao nível das suas reais potencialidades.

«Anita Shreve alterna cenas do passado e do presente, à medida que Kathryn tenta resolver o mistério da morte de Jack (e cada vez mais, do seu casamento), enquanto é perseguida pelo escrutínio público. O suspense da narrativa aumenta ao vermos a curiosidade urgente de Kathryn contrapor-se ao seu instinto protector. Ler este romance é como desenrolar uma meada. É essencialmente um mistério.

Anita Notaro,"A maior parte das pessoas consegue lembrar-se de um momento decisivo na sua vida. Uma fração de segundo quando o tempo parou e a vida mudou para sempre. Para Lily Ormond, esse momento chegou ao fim de um dia, quando foi abrir a porta e descobriu que, enquanto estava a esmagar alho e alecrim e assistir a telenovelas, a sua irmã gémea Alison se tinha afogado. Foi difícil conciliar-se com a perda da única irmã e melhor amiga, e mais ainda tornar-se mãe de Charlie, o filho de Ali com três anos de idade, mas descobrir que a sua irmã gémea levava uma vida secreta havia anos quase destruiu Lily... E assim começa uma viagem relacionada com quatro homens que tinham feito parte de uma vida que ela nem sabia existir. Uma viagem que obriga Lily a reconciliar-se com a memória do pai que nunca se importou realmente com ela, com uma criança que precisa muito de si e com uma irmã que não era o que parecia.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Anita Notaro\Ha Sempre um Amanha (2921)\cover.jpg,9789898228864,2012-04-30T13:51:49+01:00,Leya,3,,1.0,"Fiction, Contemporary, General, Autores Estrangeiros, Romance",Há Sempre um Amanhã,2921
André Malraux,"Numa Xangai rendida à violência, quatro homens vivem o fervilhar dos primeiros dias da revolução chinesa de 1927: Kyo Gisors, um dos líderes da luta comunista, idealista e intelectual, a braços com a sua própria crise familiar; Tchen, um terrorista atormentado pelos assassínios perpetrados; Clappique, um boémio francês, traficante de ópio e negociador de armas; e Katov, o revolucionário russo que tranquilamente observa o desenrolar dos acontecimentos até ao momento do seu sacrifício derradeiro. Publicado em 1933, e nesse mesmo ano distinguido com o Prémio Goncourt, A Condição Humana é um documento incontornável de reflexão sobre o indivíduo, sobre o confronto entre ética pessoal e convicção ideológica, sobre traição e morte, sobre amor e liberdade. Uma «duradoura obra-prima da literatura universal», escreve Jorge de Sena, tradutor e prefaciador desta edição portuguesa, depois de cuja leitura «se não é o mesmo».

Porém, não se trata de um anjo da guarda mas sim de um chantagista manipulador da pior espécie... e os acontecimentos que se seguem são verdadeiramente aterradores.

Anatole France,"Uma comunidade de pinguins vê sua harmonia se esfacelar ao ser transformada em sociedade humana. Com esta situação imaginária Anatole France não só comprova ter visto muito mais longe que seus contemporâneos - pois antecipa o conflito mundial de 1914 - como traça um painel tão rico quanto atual da natureza do homem. Sarcasmo, ironia e certa dose de pessimismo juntam-se às anedotas, lendas e discussões acaloradas que percorrem toda a obra e enfatizam a desconcertante irreverência do autor.

Anaïs Nin,"“Questo libro è scritto senza testimoni, un edificio senza dimensioni, una città appesa al cielo”  
La casa dell’incesto è la storia della dolorosa situazione di una donna divisa, incapace di trovare un collegamento tra il corpo e la propria vita emotiva. “Ho scritto le prime due pagine del mio nuovo libro in uno stile surrealista,” annota nel suo diario la Nin nell’aprile del 1932. E in effetti si tratta di un testo audacemente sperimentale, sospeso tra il romanzo e la prosa lirica, che rappresenta il felice punto d’incontro tra i due momenti fondamentali dell’ispirazione di Anaïs Nin: da una parte, la ricerca di una totale e potente naturalezza nell’esprimere la vita e l’emozione dei sensi; dall’altra, il proposito di “procedere dal sogno per entrare nel dato sensibile”, cioè di immergere l’esperienza onirica nel flusso della vita quotidiana, accostandosi alle ricerche del gruppo surrealista. Nasce così quello che è, forse, il libro letterariamente più elaborato e intenso della Nin: un racconto allucinato, “stratosferico”, caratterizzato da una prosa sontuosa e musicale, da una ragnatela sottile ma fortissima di immagini e di suoni, “la mia stagione all’inferno”, come ebbe a definirlo l’autrice stessa. Un poema in prosa unico nel suo genere. Un montaggio/travestimento “surrealista”: il mondo interiore e onirico di una donna. **

Na carruagem, além de Joaquim, viajam os revoltosos do golpe da Marinha Grande, feitos prisioneiros pela Polícia de Salazar, que cumprem a primeira etapa de uma viagem com destino a Cabo Verde, onde inaugurarão o campo de concentração do Tarrafal.

O mais longe que posso recordar na minha existência humana, vejo-me feliz. 
Era uma grande casa de aldeia, a nossa. Havia ali de tudo quanto pode desejar uma criança acostumada à simplicidade da vida campestre. 
Os pátios eram habitados por uma multidão de animais domésticos, que nos conheciam bem, de tanto milho que às escondidas lhes deitávamos. 
Eu era a mais velha, e os meus quatro irmãozitos seguiam-me alegremente pelos campos fora, como um rebanho segue o pastor. Nada nos era defeso, nem parede que não tivéssemos escalado, nem árvore que não conhecêssemos como os nossos dedos. Os frutos eram vigiados desde que as árvores se cobriam de prometedoras flores, e antes, muito antes da família os ver em casa, já nós tínhamos feito a nossa primeira escolha. Quando a nossa pobre burrica descansava do fatigante trabalho da nora, íamos desamarrá-la da manjedoura, saltávamos-lhe para cima, e fazíamo-la trotar pelos caminhos pedregosos da aldeia como um pur-sang trotaria nas avenidas areadas dum luxuoso parque.

"Américo Olavo, 1881-1927","Nesta má, desastrosa situação moral, se fez o embarque do primeiro contingente para França, seguindo-se os outros sem perturbações, sem lutas e direi mesmo dalguns, com confiança, quase com alegria. Não se podia, é certo, evitar que dentro de cada corporação alguns oficiais recalcassem, enquanto em Portugal, a sua relutância contra a vinda, mascarando-a com uma pretendida campanha republicana e moralista contra o governo democrático, acocorando-se por detrás da oposição que lhe era movida por um já referido partido da República. Mas todos marcharam, alegres uns, dispostos às contingências das suas obrigações muitos, alguns ainda ruminando ódios contra aqueles que os tinham compelido à situação de terem de lutar pelo presente e pelo futuro do seu país, em vez de os terem deixado devorar tranquilamente o soldo – que só para esse efeito tinham ingressado no exército – os que eram do quadro permanente.
  

Américo Olavo Correia de Azevedo (1881-1927) nasceu no Funchal a 16 de Dezembro de 1881. Fez parte, como capitão de infantaria, das tropas portuguesas que se bateram em França ao lado dos aliados, sendo condecorado com a Cruz de Guerra e com a 3ª classe da ordem da Torre e Espada por actos de bravura praticados durante a campanha. Tendo sido feito prisioneiro pelos alemães na Batalha de La Lys (9 de Abril de 1918), só voltou a Portugal nos princípios de 1919. Foi eleito deputado pelo Funchal nas eleições que se realizaram em 11 de Maio do mesmo ano. Maçon desde 1901, foi membro do grupo dos Jovens Turcos, sucessivamente democrático e reconstituinte. Exerceu o cargo de Ministro da Guerra de 8 de Maio a 6 de Julho de 1924. Morreu na revolta de 8 de Fevereiro de 1927. Escreveu a obra memorialista Na Grande Guerra(Guimarães & Cª Editores, 1919). Em coautoria com Chagas Franco, publicou a colectânea Centro da vida; Os preconceitos da viscondessa; Suzana; Rebelde; Cartão de uma noiva; O pequeno cantor; Estéril; Uma Tragédia (Liv. Guimarães, 1909).

E uma só, dentre tantas, o juro,  
Uma só com verdade a encontrei. 
Essa entrou-me pela alma tão firme,  
Tão segura por dentro a fechou,  
Que o passado fugiu da memória,

Alison Wearing,"Alison Wearing é uma jornalista canadiana e multi-premiada autora de livros de viagens. Visitou o Irão durante um ano e relata-nos essa viagem, dando-nos o retrato das várias pessoas com quem ela e Ian, suposto marido que com ela viajou, já que para uma mulher será praticamente impossível fazer turismo sozinha no país de Kohmeini, se cruzaram ao longo da estadia. Não se pense que Wearing adopta uma postura de quem está acima. Ela limita-se a relatar e retratar pessoas e situações, com ironia, subtileza e humor, e, ao mesmo tempo, a tentar perceber uma sociedade que é bastante diferente da nossa e que poderá mesmo inspirar o medo, tal como acontecia com a jornalista/escritora antes de se decidir visitar o Irão.   
"" A infinita generosidade que se depreende dos encontros narrados por Wearing alia-se a uma ironia subtil na forma como a autora lida com assuntos mais delicados, nomeadamente o da condição feminina. ""Subitamente reparo que todas as mulheres e raparigas usam o 'chadoor' por cima do resto da roupa. (...) que a devastadora diferença dos nossos fatos é a postura que eles proporcionam. Eu tenho o lenço de cabeça apertado, o casaco abotoado, as mão livres; posso estar de cabeça levantada, tenho liberdade de movimentos. A grande dificuldade do 'chadoor' é mantê-lo no sítio. Estar na vertical com as mãos desocupadas implica deixá-lo cair"" (pág. 237). O humor está sempre presente.""

Alicia Kopf,"Um magistral romance de estreia que tem no gelo o seu eixo central: o gelo real, das regiões mais frias do planeta; e o gelo metafórico, das relações com os outros e com o mundo.  Prémio Documenta * Prémio Llibreter * Prémio Ojo Crítico * Prémio Cálamo «É mais fácil chegar ao Ártico do que a certas regiões de si mesmo.» Esta é a história de uma artista em busca de um caminho. É ainda a história do seu fascínio pelo gelo, da obsessão pelos pólos da Terra e por quem teve a coragem de os desbravar: heróis como Scott, Amundsen e Shackleton, que pela primeira vez pisaram as regiões geladas do planeta. Mas há outros gelos neste romance, talvez ainda mais frios do que os gelos reais: o irmão de gelo da narradora, que vive congelado dentro de si mesmo, aprisionado pelo autismo; e o gelo das relações familiares, um espaço de convivência frio, carregado de silêncios e mutismos, marcado por amores falhados. Num romance lírico e comovente que desafia todos os géneros, Alicia Kopf traça a ténue linha de separação entre dois mundos - o da realidade e o do desejo; o do afecto e o da distância - para pôr a nu o abismo entre o que somos e a marca que deixamos no mundo. Romance de estreia assinalável, Irmão de gelo conquistou a crítica e venceu importantes prémios literários. Os elogios da crítica:«O gelo como metáfora, como aventura épica, como presença quotidiana. Escrita depurada, cristalina, de rara beleza. Expedições polares, relações familiares, autismo, arte, amizades, Islândia... Poucas vezes um primeiro romance nos comoveu tanto.»Júri do XVI Prémio Cálamo) «Um livro lindo. Kopf é uma importante ave rara na literatura espanhola. Fria e quentíssima. Simultaneamente íntima e distante.»ABC «Uma história cativante que maravilha e se revela um manual de sobrevivência milagroso, altamente recomendado para mentes inquietas.»Nació Digital «Um dos melhores livros do ano. Um livro que está destinado a ser importante para alguns leitores, em primeiro lugar porque coloca perguntas oportunas. (...) Na sua viagem introspectiva e abismal, não se permite nada que não seja aventura, nada que não seja incómodo e verdadeiro.»Ali Smith, The Sunday Telegraph «Assombroso. A força narrativa é torrencial: desde o arranque deslumbrante, que desenha o conflito do narrador e protagonista, aos círculos sucessivos em que se desdobra o romance. É uma obra de ficção que perdura.»El Cultural «Neste assombroso Irmão de gelo, Kopf narra como nos expomos ao risco e à solidão de uma expedição polar quando tentamos abrir novos caminhos na escrita. Para Kopf, a arte contemporânea distingue-se pela necessidade de ampliação de fronteiras e limites; algo que não acontece, por exemplo, no limitado âmbito narrativo espanhol.»Enrique Vila-Matas «Kopf expõe diante dos nossos olhos um amplo catálogo de emoções que, como os pólos, são móveis e necessitam de uma épica para existir.»Agustín Fernández Mallo «Irmão de gelo é, indiscutivelmente, uma das pérolas da temporada, o livro geracional de que o panorama narrativo espanhol precisava. Um romance que é muitos romances ao mesmo tempo.»SModa «Mais do que apenas ler-se, Irmão de gelo devora-se, com a emoção de quem pensa que a escrita fala directamente com o leitor.»Charles Baxter",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Alicia Kopf\Irmao de gelo (2946)\cover.jpg,9789896655358,2018-01-31T12:59:00+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,3,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction, Writing, General",Irmão de gelo,2946
Alice Walker,"Um clássico da literatura. Um importante manifesto.  Um clássico da literatura americana, aclamado pela crítica e amado por sucessivas gerações de leitores. Tão relevante hoje quanto no ano da sua publicação, é uma extraordinária peça de ficção que combate o ódio, a desigualdade e a violência, ao mesmo tempo que celebra o amor pela vida.  «Uma exuberante celebração do que significa ser mulher.» Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Celie, de 14 anos, escreve cartas a Deus para tentar compreender o que lhe está a acontecer. Órfã de mãe, abusada pelo homem a quem chama ""pai"", separada da irmã, Netie, privada dos dois filhos e oferecida em casamento a um homem que a maltrata, considera-se «uma negra, pobre e feia"". Até que conhece Sugar, a amante do marido. Com a ajuda de Sugar, «a mulher mais linda» que ela viu na vida, Celie descobre não só o paradeiro da irmã desaparecida mas também o próprio corpo, o prazer, o amor e, acima de tudo, a sua voz. Romance epistolar composto pelas cartas que Celie endereça a Deus com uma honestidade brutal e pelos relatos de viagem que Nettie lhe envia de uma missão em África, A Cor Púrpura aborda temas como a violência brutal a que estavam sujeitas as mulheres negras no início do século XX, a relação dos negros com o seu passado de escravatura, e a busca do espiritual num mundo cruel e sem sentido. Galardoado com o prémio Pulitzer e com o National Book Award para o melhor livro de ficção, A Cor Púrpura foi adaptado ao cinema em 1985 por Steven Spielberg e nomeado para 11 Óscares. Os elogios da crítica:«Alice Walker é uma escritora maravilhosamente talentosa.»The New York Times Book Review «A cor púrpura coloca Walker á altura de Faulkner.»The Nation «Um romance sempre em vigor.»Newsweek «Óptimo. Um livro para colocar entre os clássicos da literatura de todos os tempos.»San Francisco Chronicle «Um livro que genuinamente nos faz pensar.»Guardian «Uma fábula para o mundo moderno.»Washington Post «Um livro impressionante e brilhantemente concebido. . . uma saga cheia de alegria e dor, humor e amargura, e uma série de personagens que vivem, respiram e iluminam o mundo das mulheres negras.»Publishers Weekly «A cor púrpura é uma celebração exuberante de tudo o que significa ser mulher, ser uma mulher negra e gostar das melhores celebrações, é honesta. A honestidade de Alice Walker neste livro é combativa, implacável e redentora. É dessa honestidade que surge a amargura e, no entanto, a amargura nunca macula a humanidade da visão de Walker. Adoro que A cor púrpura não tente amenizar seus golpes, mas também seja corajoso o suficiente para manter uma fé maravilhosamente afirmativa na possibilidade, no perdão, na bondade e na esperança.»Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie «Uma das escritoras americanas mais talentosas.»Isabel Allende «Às vezes engraçado, principalmente comovente e ainda enfeitiçado com um encanto de conto de fadas, A cor púrpura aborda bravamente questões sociais e deve ser leitura obrigatória para todos, especialmente para aqueles que ainda optam por fechar os olhos aos abusos e violências cometidos por conta do sexismo e racismo.»Open Road Review Magazine",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Alice Walker\A Cor Purpura (2947)\cover.jpg,9789896657109,2018-11-16T12:33:37+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Feminism, Fiction, Religião e Espiritualidade, Women, General, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros, Epistolary, African American, Romance",A Cor Púrpura,2947

Alfredo Hogon,"A Mão do Finado”, foi inicialmente publicado no “Jornal do Comércio”, do Rio, como sendo da autoria de Alexandre Dumas e continuação de “O Conde de Monte Cristo”. Na verdade, quem o escreveu foi o jornalista português Alfredo Possolo Hogon. Dumas chegou a escrever uma carta protestando contra tal empulhação, mas de nada adiantou. “A Mão do Finado” foi depois editado em livro, em Portugal, e, por incrível que pareça, traduzido para o francês e incluído nas obras completas do mestre francês.

Publicadas em dois volumes, em 1851, estas “Lendas e Narrativas” de Alexandre Herculano são uma coletâneo de histórias publicadas entre 1839 e 1844 nas revistas O Panorama e A Ilustração. Nelas Herculano aborda vários períodos da história da Península Ibérica. É evidente a preferência do autor pela Idade Média, época em que, segundo ele, se encontravam as raízes da nacionalidade portuguesa. No prefácio original, Herculano considera as pequenas narrativas “monumentos dos esforços do autor para introduzir na literatura nacional um género amplamente cultivado, nestes nossos tempos, em todos os países da Europa”, esperando que venham a constituir “a sementinha de onde proveio a floresta”, “um marco humilde e rude” na história literária portuguesa. 
Alexandre Herculano foi o principal responsável pela introdução e pelo desenvolvimento da narrativa histórica em Portugal tal como Walter Scott foi em Inglaterra e Vítor Hugo na França.

Alexandra Marques,"Que segredos poderão ser revelados sobre a descolonização de Angola? O que terá sido discutido na ilha do Sal (em Setembro de 1974) entre Spínola e Mobutu sobre as condições de transferência do Poder para a FNLA? Que facilidades concedeu o Almirante Rosa Coutinho aos Movimentos de Libertação ainda antes do Acordo do Alvor? Porque insiste Almeida Santos que as reuniões de Argel (em Novembro de 1974) entre Melo Antunes e Agostinho Neto resultaram no guião da Penina? Porque quiseram os negociadores nacionais manter secreto o protocolo-anexo ao Acordo que nunca foi divulgado? E que posição assumiram em relação aos bens imóveis dos portugueses residentes no território? Qual o papel de Mário Soares enquanto Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros? Qual a razão do conflito entre a Coordenadora do Programa do MFA para Angola e o Alto-comissário Silva Cardoso? 
De que forma Rosa Coutinho ajudou o MPLA (a partir de 11 de Março de 1975) e como se articulou com o apoio logístico soviético e cubano recebido por este Movimento? O que levou Lisboa a ordenar às autoridades militares em Luanda a permissão ao desembarque na costa angolana de material bélico para o MPLA e quis que a tropa portuguesa impedisse a reentrada da FNLA em Luanda depois de expulsa da capital pelo MPLA em finais de Julho? Porque tardou a evacuação dos portugueses e que interesse tinham os EUA no retorno em massa para ajudar o Grupo dos Nove a impedir que Portugal ficasse, como Angola, sob influência soviética? 
«… Embora a expressão “descolonização” seja recorrente para descrever as transições para as independências, o termo é inapropriado para definir o que foi uma mera transferência de poderes para os Movimentos armados, num processo que (como refere Pedro Pezarat Correia) não envolveu “exclusivamente nem sequer predominantemente o país colonizador”. Justifica quem coordenou o MFA em Angola até Janeiro de 1975 (participante na maioria das rondas negociais) que a “imperativa necessidade de negociar previamente um cessar-fogo” implicou “imediatas cedências politicas” num drama em vários actos, em que o Estado português não foi “o único actor, nem sequer o protagonista”. Acabou, desta forma, por ser “fortemente condicionado” pelos angolanos e pela comunidade internacional, confrontando-se no final com um desfecho que escapou “totalmente ao seu controlo”. A documentação consultada corrobora esta análise, mas demonstra também a responsabilidade de cada um dos decisores individualmente e dos colectivos envolvidos.»

Alexandra Lucas Coelho,"Grande Prémio de Romance APE  Uma história de amor impossível germina no momento em que se instala uma nova ordem política no Médio Oriente, com a morte de Yasser Arafat.  «O som entra pelo quarto como um encantador de serpentes, enlaça-nos. Flutuamos sobre Gaza. Somos um.» «Afinal, esse amor, está onde?» Ana e Léon conhecem-se em Jerusalém, na véspera da morte de Yasser Arafat. Ana é catalã, repórter e vive sozinha. Léon, também repórter, vive na Bélgica, com a mulher e os filhos. Juntos, calcorreiam Israel e os Territórios Palestinianos Ocupados: Gaza, Cisjordânia, Jerusalém Oriental.

Os dois adivinham que o romance tem o tempo contado, mas não resistem a acrescentar-lhe dias. Anos mais tarde, em Damasco, pouco antes de rebentar a guerra síria, Ana conta-nos a história desse amor possível.

Alexandra Lucas Coelho,"'O México deste começo de século é difícil de diagnosticar. Ao lado de uma das mais belas tradições culturais do planeta está uma das mais assombrosas lógicas de violência. Sobretudo no que possui de próximo e dependente dos Estados Unidos da América, o México é o inferno na terra para muitos analistas. Alexandra Lucas Coelho, uma das jornalistas mais talentosas de sua geração, desce a esse inferno e demonstra que, mesmo quando a esperança dá sinal de desaparecer, não é só inferno. Em torno das sociedades complexas há sempre fortuna e maldições. É preciso curiosidade e paixão para se dispor diante dos seus quadros intermináveis, mas é preciso inteligência para desconfiar do que está na superfície, e do que a separa dos fragmentos incomensuráveis do fundo.

Alexandra Lucas Coelho,"Provavelmente, não há hoje boas razões para se falar de Jalalabad, de Kandahar ou de Mazar-i-Sharif. Ouvimos estes nomes quase diariamente associados a mortos e feridos. Conseguimos imaginar homens de barba e mulheres de burqa. Conseguimos até imaginar o cheiro a lixo às portas de Herat, onde «cheira tão mal como se tudo estivesse podre». Já não seremos capazes de imaginar, entre o cheiro a lixo, o perfume a rosas: «No meio do trânsito mais tóxico há rotundas com rosas lindas em Cabul.»  
Aquilo que aqui, a ocidente, a milhares de quilómetros de distância, é apenas um borrão sem nome, uma massa de ideias vagas e de lugares-comuns, toma a forma de gente concreta, ganha contornos, espessura, rosto.  
O facto de Alexandra Lucas Coelho escrever tão bem faz o resto. É o meio de transporte em que viajamos por um lugar aonde, é quase certo, nunca iríamos de outro modo.

Mas Featherbank tem um passado sombrio. Há 20 anos, Frank Carter, um perverso assassino em série, raptou e assassinou cinco rapazes.

Aldous Huxley,"Um clássico moderno, o romance distópico de Aldous Huxley é indispensável para quem busca leituras sobre autoritarismo, manipulação genética, ficção especulativa e outros temas que, embora tenham surgido com força durante a primeira metade do século XX, se tornam cada dia mais atuais.Em uma sociedade organizada segundo princípios estritamente científicos, Bernard Marx, um psicólogo, sente-se inadequado quando se compara aos outros seres de sua casta. Ao descobrir uma “reserva histórica” que preserva costumes de uma sociedade anterior – muito semelhante à do leitor – Bernard vai perceber as diferenças entre esta civilização e a sua – e a partir de um sentimento de inconformismo ele desafiará o mundo. A história de Bernard se passa em um ambiente em que a literatura, a música e o cinema só têm a função de solidificar a alienação; um universo que louva o avanço da técnica, a produção em série, a uniformidade contra a diversidade.Muitas das previsões de Huxley vieram a ser confirmadas anos mais tarde, como a tecnologia reprodutiva, as supostas técnicas de aprendizado durante o sono e a manipulação pelo condicionamento psicológico.Ao lado de obras como Fahrenheit 451, de Ray Bradbury e 1984, de George Orwell, que criticavam os governos totalitários de esquerda e de direita, Admirável Mundo Novo figura na lista dos livros mais relevantes e influentes de todos os tempos.

Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn,"Escrito clandestinamente de 1958 a 1967, o manuscrito de O arquipélago Gulag foi descoberto pelo KGB em 1973, na sequência da prisão de Elizabeth Voronskaïa, uma colaboradora de Soljenítsin que o dactilografava. Na sequência disso, Soljenítsin, que tinha sido galardoado com o Prémio Nobel em 1970, decide publicar o livro no exterior. Uma primeira edição em russo é publicada em Paris ainda em 1973 e depois finalmente a edição francesa, no verão de 1974. Soljenítsin fora entretanto preso, acusado de traição, despojado da nacionalidade soviética e enviado para o exílio, onde estará vinte anos, até ao seu regresso à Rússia em 1994. 
Para realizar este extraordinário livro, Soljenítsin foi ajudado pelo testemunho de 227 sobreviventes dos campos do Gulag. O livro agora publicado pela Sextante, no âmbito do projeto de edição em língua portuguesa das principais obras do autor, é a versão abreviada, num só volume, preparada por Soljenítsin e por sua mulher, Natália, com o objetivo de tornar mais acessível este livro aos leitores estrangeiros e a novos leitores. Traduzida diretamente do russo por António Pescada, eis pois uma obra excecional, um livro de combate contra o totalitarismo de face estalinista, um livro que ainda hoje nos queima as mãos. 
Não esqueçamos as palavras de Soljenítsin: «Devemos condenar publicamente a ideia de que homens possam exercer tal violência sobre outros homens. Calando o mal, fechando-o dentro do nosso corpo para que não saia para o exterior, afinal semeamo-lo.»

Alberto Caeiro & Fernando Pessoa,"Antologia poética do heterónimo de Fernando Pessoa, Alberto Caeiro, que reúne todos os poemas publicados nos livros “O Guardador de Rebanhos”, “O Pastor Amoroso” e “Poemas inconjuntos”. 
Não tenho ambições nem desejos 
Ser poeta não é uma ambição minha 
É a minha maneira de estar sozinho. 
Alberto Caeiro foi, como admitiu muitas vezes Fernando Pessoa, um dos seus heterónimos que mais gostava e admirava. Foi criado quando um dia Fernando Pessoa se lembrou de fazer uma partida ao seu amigo, o escritor Mário de Sá-Carneiro, mandando-lhe um poema e dizendo que era de um suposto conhecido. Quando finalmente pôs a descoberto a mentira disse-lhe por carta: 
“Quis inventar um poeta bucólico, de espécie complicada, e apresentar-lho, já me não lembro como, em qualquer espécie de realidade. Levei uns dias a elaborar o poeta mas nada consegui. Num dia em que finalmente desistira — foi em 8 de Março de 1914 — aproximei-me de uma cómoda alta, e, tomando um papel, comecei a escrever, de pé, como escrevo sempre que posso. E escrevi trinta e tantos poemas a fio, numa espécie de êxtase cuja natureza não conseguirei definir. Foi o dia mais triunfal da minha vida, e nunca poderei ter outro assim. Abri com um título, “O Guardador de Rebanhos”. E o que se seguiu foi o aparecimento de alguém em mim, a quem dei desde logo o nome de Alberto Caeiro. Desculpa-me o absurdo da frase: “aparecera em mim o meu mestre” mas foi essa a sensação imediata que tive.” 
Em mais detalhes, Fernando Pessoa escreveu que o imaginou como tendo nascido em Lisboa, em 1889 e morrido em 1915, mas que viveu quase toda a sua vida no campo, com uma tia-avó idosa, porque tinha ficado órfão de pais cedo. Era louro, de olhos azuis. Como educação, apenas tinha tirado a instrução primária e não tinha profissão. 
Fernando Pessoa diria ainda que, quando escrevia em nome de Caeiro, fazia-o “por pura e inesperada inspiração, sem saber ou sequer calcular que iria escrever.” 
Como poeta, Alberto Caeiro apresenta-se como um simples “guardador de rebanhos” que escreve sobre a natureza e só se importa em ver de forma objetiva e natural a realidade. Ao mesmo tempo despreza e repreende qualquer tipo de pensamento filosófico, afirmando que pensar obstrui a visão (“pensar é estar doente dos olhos”). 
É pois um poeta de extrema simplicidade que considera que a sensação é a única realidade e que refletir sobre como as coisas são é entrar num mundo complexo, desnecessário e problemático onde tudo é incerto e obscuro. 
Fernando Pessoa chamava-o de “Mestre Ingénuo” e considerava-o o maior dos seus heterónimos.

Albert Cohen & António Pescada,"Passado entre Genebra e França, em 1936, numa época em que o antissemitismo alcança na Alemanha o seu auge, Bela do Senhor relata, com lirismo romântico e uma ironia feroz, a relação impetuosa entre Solal, judeu, alto funcionário da Sociedade das Nações, e Ariane, aristocrata protestante casada com um seu subordinado, desde o primeiro encontro até à agonia final, passando pela conquista, a paixão e a implacável degradação dos sentimentos. Em pano de fundo, um universo ambivalente e estruturado por antagonismos: a gente comum e os novos-ricos, os dominados e os dominantes, a aristocracia e a burguesia, os judeus e os protestantes, o sexismo e a imagem sagrada da mulher.

Tu És o Meu Coração é a história de Nelson, um cão que se deixa levar pela sua curiosidade e se perde, separando-se assim da sua dona. Esta comovente história segue Nelson na sua caminhada de oito anos longe de casa até ao dia em que, milagrosamente, se reúne com a sua família.

Al Berto,"Entrevista a Al Berto, a propósito da edição de Horto de Incêndio, a Manuel Hermínio Monteiro.   
Em Março de 1997, o editor Manuel Hermínio Monteiro entrevista o poeta Al Berto, a propósito da edição daquele que viria a ser o seu último livro de poemas originais publicado, Horto de Incêndio. O poeta faleceria em Julho desse ano.   
Esta curta entrevista, com um evidente carácter de urgência, foi feita como complemento do seu último livro Horto de Incêndio. Não esperava tanta brevidade nas respostas. Hoje, parece-me, faz todo o sentido. Como julgo natural que a grande maioria dos leitores de Al Berto sejam jovens que viam nele a intensidade chispante de um cantor rock deambulando pelas noites de Lisboa com uma disponibilidade de diálogo e de corpo inexcedíveis. Por isso se nos torna difícil ver uma Lisboa tardia sem a sua presença, o seu sorriso e as suas histórias envolventes. Sem os seus textos para os catálogos de artistas amigos.   
As inúmeras leituras públicas sempre repletas de gente jovem, que acorria para ouvir o homem a quem «crescera uma pérola no coração». Mas quem melhor o conhecia era o mar e os barcos que «faziam escala à sua porta». 
Outubro de 1997  
*1 – Há bastante tempo que não publicavas e no entanto este livro, até pelo título, tem um carácter de urgência. Porquê?*  
Telegrama 1: Todos os meus livros tiveram sempre um carácter de urgência.  
Porque ao terminar um livro nunca tive a certeza que um outro se seguisse. Cada  
um deles está intrinsecamente ligado a um momento da minha vida. A vida e os  
livros acontecem… Stop. 
*2 – Há os poemas «inferno», «sida», «febre», «fantasma», «senhor da asma». É um livro triste, trágico quase apocalíptico?*  
Telegrama 2: Não podia ser de outra maneira. Veja-se os tempos que correm,  
tempos de manipulação e de enxertia, tempos de metamorfose maligna e  
hipocrisia. Já não há cidadãos, mas contribuintes – o que quer dizer que o corpo  
foi substituído por uma série de algarismos. Stop. 
*3 – A segunda parte, «Morte de Rimbaud» foi dito em voz alta no Coliseu dos Recreios de Lisboa. Ao escreveres existe alguma vontade de que as tuas palavras sejam para ser ditas em voz alta?*  
Telegrama 3: Sempre defendi a oralidade. É uma tradição da poesia portuguesa.  
Não publico poemas sem os lerem voz alta muitas vezes. «Morte de Rimbaud»  
foi escrito propositadamente para o espectáculo Filhos de Rimbaud e para ser  
dito em voz alta. Tentei ser claro. Stop. 
*4 – Coloquiais e íntimos, poemas como pequenos segredos ou conversas afectivas. Esta tua poesia parece nascer da necessidade de uma confidência. A poesia é feita para todos?*  
Telegrama 4: Se calhar é porque toda a minha escrita é um dialogo comigo  
mesmo… Uma viagem em direcção ao silêncio. Não sei… Não. A poesia não é  
feita para ninguém em especial, mas uma vez publicada é para quem a lê. Talvez  
este livro seja um livro para ler também em voz alta. Stop. 
*5 – O que é que a tua vida deve à poesia?*   
Telegrama 5: A poesia tem-me levado ao despojamento daquilo que é lixo e me  
atrapalha a vida. Cada vez mais me parece que a poesia é a única linguagem  
capaz de atingir o rosto de um deus e feri-lo moralmente, nem que fosse por um  
milésimo de segundo. Stop.

Agustina Bessa Luís,"*A Sibila* é um romance de Agustina Bessa-Luís. Sibila, que remete para a figura clássica da Sibila de Delfos, significa adivinha e refere-se à personagem Joaquina Teixeira, a Quina. 
O livro não se atreve a narrar a história do nascimento à morte da protagonista, mas conta a vida de duas gerações anteriores da família Teixeira e duma posterior e ainda de outras famílias e amigos próximos desta. Narra conspirações, corrupções e intrigas de parentes, criados, amigos e inimigos. 
De passagem ocorrem críticas à burguesia rural, mas no romance avulta sobretudo uma reflexão sobre a dimensão metafísica do ser humano. 
Quina não tinha poderes sobrenaturais, era apenas atilada e prática conselheira; ninguém da sua igualha a tratava por sibila. Morreu velha e doente, mas orgulhosa da casa que salvara da falência e da fortuna que amealhara. 
A história começa e termina com Germa, sua sobrinha, filha do irmão Abel, que representa uma geração já urbana, desenraizada dum espaço a que Quina sempre se sentira presa.

Ahmadou Kourouma,"""Alá Não é Obrigado"" é uma obra tão peculiar quanto o seu protagonista e narrador, Birahima, uma criança-soldado que assiste à morte da mãe e que, para sobreviver, sai da sua aldeia em busca da tia, a única pessoa que pode cuidar dele. Da Costa do Marfim à Serra Leoa, passando pela Libéria, este órfão de “dez ou doze anos” irá passar por diversos exércitos de guerrilheiros, cujos líderes constituem uma riquíssima paleta de personagens, inesquecíveis pelas piores razões: há loucos e sádicos, psicopatas e figuras ridículas. A traição, a morte, a tortura e a mutilação são lugares-comuns por aquelas paragens. O próprio Birahima não é inocente nem culpado: é apenas uma criança que já viu demasiada violência e morte e de quem, à partida, se poderá pensar já não possuir qualquer noção do bem e do mal. Mas Birahima ainda consegue fazer essa distinção; só que as suas principais preocupações prendem-se com coisas tão fundamentais como sobreviver, alimentar-se, encontrar um sítio para viver e, acima de tudo, evitar ser assassinado. 
""Alá Não é Obrigado"" é um livro duro, poderoso, intenso, escrito por um autor que muito nos disse sobre a África contemporânea: as estranhas alianças entre chefes de Estado respeitáveis e criminosos de renome, a corrupção generalizada, a culpa, as boas intenções e as dificuldades das Nações Unidas e os desvios sofridos pelos mantimentos enviados pelas organizações não-governamentais. Em suma, uma realidade terrível que o autor nos descreve pela voz inesquecível de uma criança.

Agatha Christie,"Roger Ackroyd sabia de mais. Sabia que a mulher que amava envenenara o primeiro marido, um homem extremamente violento, e suspeitava que ela era vítima de chantagem. Agora, que as trágicas notícias sobre a morte dela apontam para suicídio por overdose, são muitas as perguntas que parecem não ter resposta.O perplexo Ackroyd decide investigar, uma decisão que tem consequências inesperadas. Ao deparar-se com as primeiras pistas sobre o caso, Ackroyd transforma-se no novo alvo do criminoso.O Dr. Sheppard, médico da aldeia, fala então com o vizinho, um detetive reformado que escolhera o campo para passar tranquilamente os seus últimos anos de vida.

Agatha Christie,"A convite da sua velha amiga Ariadne Oliver, Hercule Poirot vai a uma festa de verão numa aldeia encantadora do Devon. Um cenário idílico onde contavam descansar e divertir-se. Ariadne inventara até um jogo de Caça ao Assassino para animar os convivas, mas não antecipara sentir-se tão… atormentada. A sua intuição diz-lhe que algo está terrivelmente errado. E, como o magnífico detetive belga bem sabe, a intuição feminina é algo que nunca se deve menosprezar… Em 1954, Agatha Christie escreveu Hercule Poirot e o Crime de Greenshore sob o formato de conto. O objetivo era angariar fundos para a igreja da sua paróquia. Contudo, a Rainha do Crime mudou de ideias e transformou-o num romance, doando, em seu lugar, um conto de Miss Marple. Hercule Poirot e o Crime de Greenshore acabaria por não ser publicado na sua forma original, servindo apenas de base para o enredo do romance Jogo Macabro. Permaneceu “adormecido” durante sessenta anos. Até agora…

Com apenas vinte e quatro horas para descobrir o assassino, Hercule Poirot relembra um comentário que ouvira por acaso, ainda em Jerusalém: “Compreendes que ela tem de ser morta, não compreendes?”.

João Ricardo Pedro,"Tudo começa com um homem saindo de casa, armado, numa madrugada fria. Mas do que o move só saberemos quase no fim, por uma carta escrita de outro continente. Ou talvez nem aí. Parece, afinal, mais importante a história do doutor Augusto Mendes, o médico que o tratou quarenta anos antes, quando lho levaram ao consultório muito ferido. Ou do seu filho António, que fez duas comissões em África e conheceu a madrinha de guerra numa livraria. Ou mesmo do neto, Duarte, que um dia andou de bicicleta todo nu. Através de episódios aparentemente autónomos - e tendo como ponto de partida a Revolução de 1974 -, este romance constrói a história de uma família marcada pelos longos anos de ditadura, pela repressão política, pela guerra colonial. Duarte, cuja infância se desenrola já sob os auspícios de Abril, cresce envolto nessas memórias alheias - muitas vezes traumáticas, muitas vezes obscuras - que formam uma espécie de trama onde um qualquer segredo se esconde. Dotado de enorme talento, pianista precoce e prodigioso, afigura-se como o elemento capaz de suscitar todas as esperanças.

Hermann Hesse,"Nascido na Índia, no século VI a.C., filho de um brâmane, Siddhartha passa a infância e a juventude isolado das misérias do mundo, gozando uma existência calma e contemplativa. A certa altura, porém, abdica da vida luxuosa, protegida, e parte em peregrinação pelo país, onde a pobreza e o sofrimento eram regra. Em páginas de rara beleza, Siddhartha descreve sensações e impressões como raramente se consegue. Lê-lo é deixar-se fluir como o rio onde Siddhartha aprende que o importante é saber escutar com perfeição. Este romance de Hermann Hesse tornou-se a obra mais famosa deste Prémio Nobel da Literatura e um dos livros mais vendidos de sempre.

Entre os seus romances, incluem-se O Lobo das Estepes, Narciso e Goldmundo e O Jogo das Contas de Vidro.

Ishmael soon learns that Ahab has one purpose on this voyage: to seek out Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white sperm whale.

Helmut Ortner,"Envolto em mistério até aos nossos dias, o nome do juiz Roland Freisler está fortemente ligado ao sistema judicial da Alemanha nazi. Além de de Secretário de Estado do Ministério da Justiça do Reich, Freisler foi o presidente do Tribunal do Povo — o homem diretamente responsável por milhares de sentenças de morte.   
O Tribunal do Povo nazi escreveu um dos capítulos mais sombrios da história alemã, já que foi o tribunal que decretou a maioria das sentenças de morte na Alemanha de Hitler e tinha apenas uma função: liquidar toda a oposição ao regime de Hitler.   
Os interrogatórios do Tribunal do Povo eram filmados com a intenção de se usarem posteriormente as imagens como propaganda. Quase todos os réus eram considerados culpados e condenados à morte por enforcamento, com as sentenças executadas no prazo de duas horas após a aprovação dos veredictos.  
O domínio das leis e a destreza verbal nos tribunais fizeram de Roland Freisler o juiz mais temido do terceiro Reich. Nos seus interrogatórios, alternava entre a frieza e a ação metódica com a impulsividade, os gritos e furiosas exaltações teatrais exercidas contra os réus.  
Esta é a história, manchada de sangue, de um juiz implacável, numa época sem piedade, uma personagem enigmática, terrível e desprovida de coração, que foi morta em fevereiro de 1945 durante um ataque aéreo dos Aliados. 
Críticas de imprensa

Gustave Flaubert,"Madame Bovary is the French writer Gustave Flaubert's debut novel. The story focuses on a doctor's wife, Emma Bovary, who has adulterous affairs and lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life. Though the basic plot is rather simple, even archetypal, the novel's true art lies in its details and hidden patterns. Flaubert was a notorious perfectionist and claimed always to be searching for le mot juste (""the precise word""). Long established as one of the greatest novels ever written, the book has often been described as a ""perfect"" work of fiction. Henry James writes: ""Madame Bovary has a perfection that not only stamps it, but that makes it stand almost alone; it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment."" Giorgio de Chirico said that in his opinion ""from the narrative point of view, the most perfect book is Madame Bovary by Flaubert"".",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Gustave Flaubert\Madame Bovary (New Edition) (3017)\cover.jpg,9783736808010,2019-06-27T14:06:01+01:00,BookRix,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Clássicos, General, Classics, Autores Estrangeiros, Literatura Francesa",Madame Bovary (New Edition),3017
Elizabeth George,"Why exists this fascination with crime on the part of female writers? Bestselling novelist Elizabeth George poses this question in her Introduction, answers it with her customary elegance and illustrates it with a rich and varied collection of international writers, some household names; others buried treasures waiting to be rediscovered. The stories have locations as diverse as Africa and the Caribbean, London and Los Angeles, San Francisco and Switzerland. Some are modern; some period. Some feature well-known sleuths - Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, Jemina Shore - or notorious villains - Jack the Ripper; others are tales of 'ordinary' people caught up in out of the ordinary events. All of them share in common a desire to explore mankind in a moment on the edge. The edge equates to the crime committed. How the characters deal with the edge is the story.

Através do relato da sua viagem, Pereira, que deixara Paris com o seu grande amigo e companheiro Pierre, leva-nos a conhecer o Brasil em guerra com o vizinho Paraguai, no período mais decisivo da sua história. Uma guerra sangrenta que o Brasil trava ao lado da Argentina e do Uruguai e que, para Pereira e Pierre, será o momento decisivo das suas vidas. É também a guerra pelo espaço vital das populações índias que, humilhadas pela acomodação forçada às regras e vivências dos colonos, tentam recuperar a sua Terra Mítica onde o Mal não existe. É ainda a guerra travada por Pierre para se definir a si mesmo: índio, como o seu povo, ou europeu, tal como foi criado? Levado em criança por Auguste de Saint Hillaire do Brasil para França, descobre, já adulto, nas feições de dois índios presos, a chave para as suas raízes nunca explicadas. Raízes que vai encontrar nesse cruzamento do Rio da Prata onde brasileiros e paraguaios morrem aos milhares e os índios guarani lutam por uma terra onde possam de novo viver livres e em paz. Da França à Argentina, do Brasil ao Paraguai, do sertão nordestino aos planaltos do Sul do Brasil, Pereira relata-nos de uma forma empolgante e quase cinematográfica as grandes transformações que definiram a América do Sul. Pelo caminho, encontra o amor perfeito e Pierre a pátria a que, junto dos seus, pode chamar sua.

Porém, a sua tranquilidade é subitamente interrompida quando um velho amigo e colega advogado, Roger Elliard, é brutalmente assassinado. Shardlake promete à viúva levar o culpado à justiça, mas o que pensava ser um caso de homicídio isolado é, na verdade, parte integrante de uma melodia diabólica que se propaga a uma velocidade louca pela cidade de Londres.

Michel Houellebecq,"Uma fábula política e moral surpreendente, Submissão é o romance mais visionário e simultaneamente mais realista de Michel Houellebecq.  «A liberdade de expressão é a liberdade de comunicar uma obra do espírito a outros espíritos.»Michel Houellebecq Paris, 2022: François, investigador universitário, cumpre desapaixonadamente o ofício do ensino enquanto leva uma vida calma e impermeável a grandes dramas, uma rotina de quarentão apenas ocasionalmente inflamada pelos relacionamentos passageiros com mulheres cada vez mais jovens. É também com indiferença que vai acompanhando os acontecimentos políticos do seu país. Às portas das eleições presidenciais, França está dividida. O recém-criado partido da Fraternidade Muçulmana conquista cada vez mais simpatizantes, graças ao seu carismático líder, numa disputa directa com a Frente Nacional. O país obcecado por reality shows e celebridades acorda por fim e toma de assalto as ruas de Paris: somam-se os tumultos, os carros incendiados, as mesas de voto destruídas. Afastado da universidade pela nova direcção, deprimido, François retira-se no campo, onde espera deixar de sentir as ondas de choque da capital. Regressa a Paris poucos dias depois do desfecho eleitoral e encontra um país que já não reconhece. É tempo de questionar-se sobre se deve e pode submeter-se à nova ordem. Submissão convida a uma reflexão sobre o convívio e conflito entre culturas e religiões, sobre a relação entre Ocidente e Oriente, sobre a relação entre cidadãos e instituições. Um romance que, como é habitual na obra do autor, adianta-se ao seu tempo e coloca questões prementes, hoje mais relevantes do que nunca. Michel Houellebecq confirma-se nestas páginas como um pensador temerário, capaz de detectar as grandes tensões do nosso tempo, interpretando-as com lúcida ironia.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Michel Houellebecq\Submissao (3034)\cover.jpg,9789896654801,2017-11-29T13:35:22+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction, General",Submissão,3034

Roberto Saviano,"O primeiro e imperdível romance de Roberto Saviano.  O retrato tão assustador quanto comovente de uma infância roubada. Nápoles, lugar de luz e sombra, cidade bela e terrível, o reino da Camorra. Um bando de rapazes sem rei nem roque cruza as ruas de Nápoles nas suas motorizadas. Chamam-se Marajá, Dentinho, Lollipop, Drone. Os miúdos calçam sapatos de marca e trazem tatuados nos braços os nomes das suas paranza, os seus gangues. Não querem ter de se levantar cedo todos os dias, como os pais, para ir ganhar algum. Querem mais, querem ter tudo. Em Nápoles, essa é uma possibilidade que está ao alcance daqueles que escolherem o lado certo da Camorra. E dos que não tiverem medo de matar. Ou de morrer. Nos telhados da cidade, os rapazes treinam com metralhadoras, fazem pontaria a contentores do lixo, disparam para janelas alheias. A vida de uma pessoa vale menos que uma palavra. Sentem-se imortais, até ao dia em que a sua própria vida fica no fio da navalha. Do autor de Gomorra e ZeroZeroZero - dois dos mais corajosos e impactantes livros de investigação das últimas décadas -, chega um grande romance, brutal na sua força, magistral no seu retrato de uma juventude perdida. Uma corajosa peça de ficção que se converte em crónica de uma cidade corrompida, corroída, em que o sangue se paga com sangue. Crónica de uma cidade que poderia ser muitas outras e de um tempo que requer uma urgente reflexão, Os meninos da Camorra é um romance imperdível. Os elogios da crítica: «Sinto-me muito pequeno, quase insignificante, quando comparado com a dignidade e a coragem do escritor e jornalista Roberto Saviano, o homem que teve o talento de dominar a arte da vida.»José Saramago «Devemos agradecer a Roberto Saviano ter devolvido à literatura a capacidade de abrir os olhos ea consciência.»Mario Vargas Llosa «Um romance trágico e comovente que mostra a putrefacção moral de uma sociedade.»El Cultural «É a empatia que ele cria, não a denúncia que faz, que a máfia não lhe perdoa.»La Stampa «Não é uma obra híbrida entre ficção e cónica, é um romance-romance em que o autor se dá (finalmente) a liberdade de criar. Personagens, situações, relações.»Il Fatto Quotidiano  «Uma prosa cativante, eficiente e credível. Saviano no seu melhor.»ABC Cultural «Vidas queimadas precocemente que Saviano retrata num romance terrivelmente verdadeiro.»Vanity Fair Italia «Saviano voltou a desafiar os manda-chuvas do sistema que o cerca e o ameaça. Qualquer coisa que Saviano revele ou denuncie, fá-lo com mestria narrativa. É esse o seu talento natural. Que este livro demonstra de novo, eloquentemente.»La Repubblica «Uma educação (quase) sentimental. Os meninos de Saviano são um mundo.»Corriere della Sera «A pluma audaz e sem temor de Saviano, tão conhecido por outras obras de coragem insuperável, assim como pelo seu conhecimento profundo das origens da delinquência. Uma obra do máximo interesse para o leitor, porque aplicável a tantas outras cidades.»El Diario Vasco",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Roberto Saviano\Os meninos da Camorra (3039)\cover.jpg,9789896656386,2018-06-18T14:18:11+01:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,,,1.0,"Literary, Fiction, General",Os meninos da Camorra,3039

Ou existirá uma história nova, escrita para os nossos dias e atenta às realidades do feminismo, da liberdade sexual, das convenções antenupciais e do divórcio? Início da década de 1980.

Mas Madeleine Hanna, aluna aplicada de Estudos Ingleses e romântica incurável, prepara a sua tese sobre Jane Austen e George Eliot – autoras a quem se deve o enredo conjugal que está no cerne dos melhores romances ingleses.

Há histórias, personagens, invenções sobre o mundo que podem viver connosco durante anos e anos, ser parte do nosso imaginário e suscitar em nós a linguagem dos chamados «grandes sistemas» políticos e sociais do nosso tempo.

O autor trouxe-a consigo de estação em estação, de livro para livro, em momentos de pausa, pulsão de reescrita e obra inacabada, por entre outras ficções - como um texto que estivesse à espera da sua própria completude, para só então existir fora de quem o escreveu e criou.

Manuel Vilas,"A história íntima e comovente de um homem que procura no passado  o caminho para regressar ao presente.    MELHOR LIVRO DO ANO El País * El Mundo * El Heraldo * La Vanguardia Manuel Vilas compõe, com uma voz corajosa, desencantada, poética, o relato íntimo de uma vida e de um país. Simultaneamente filho e pai, autor e narrador, Vilas escava no passado, procurando recompor as peças, lutando para fazer presente quem já não está. Porque os laços com a família, com os que amamos, mesmo que distantes ou ausentes, são o que nos sustém, o que nos define. São esses mesmos laços que nos permitem ver, à distância do tempo, que a beleza está nos mais simples gestos quotidianos, no afecto contido, inconfessado, e até nas palavras não ditas. Falando desde asentranhas, Vilas revela a comovente debilidade humana, ao mesmo tempo que ilumina a força única da nossa condição, a inexaurível capacidade de nos levantarmos de novo e seguirmos em frente, mesmo quando não parece possível. É desenhando um caminho de regresso aos que amamos que o amor pode salvar-nos. Confessional, provocador, comovente, Em tudo havia beleza é uma admirável peça de literatura, em que se entrelaçam destino pessoal e colectivo, romance e autobiografia. Manuel Vilas criou um relato íntimo de perda e vida, de luto e dor, de afecto e pudor, único na sua capacidade de comover o leitor, de fazer da sua história a história de todos nós. Os elogios da crítica: «Um livro magnífico, que é uma obra de arte sobre a vida. Mas não se sobressalte o leitor ou a leitora se, de vez em quando, tiver de suspender a leitura - para respirar, ir à janela olhar a rua, fumar um cigarro, procurar os seus mortos, como ele fazia. Voltará com ele.Porque a grande literatura é assim.» Fernanda de Abreu, Jornal de Letras «Um retrato pessoal, que no fundo é um espelho muito bem conseguido da condição humana. Pelo estilo e pelo destemor, merece a mais alta das notas.» Nuno Costa Santos, Observador «Magnífico, corajoso, vai partir-vos o coração.» Javier Cercas «Um livro que nasce da perda e, ao mesmo tempo, da luminosidade do amor.» La Vanguardia «Uma narrativa que chega ao coração da verdade e faz da vida de uma personagem um ensinamento universal.» El País «Uma confissão bela e autêntica, uma tentativa do autor de salvar a sua própria família através da verdade de um livro extraordinário.» La Razón «Este é um livro escrito com uma clareza e uma força portentosas. Nenhuma retórica, nenhuma mentira.» El Mundo «Um monumento de carne e nervos. O mais importante deste livro é o seu tratamento descarnado de uma história, das quedas do próprio autor, dos seus pais perdidos, dos seus filhos, da sua hesitação num mundo de costas voltadas para a literatura. O importante é que todos temos um caminho de regresso a um lugar de amor, que começa a desenhar-se enquanto a vida nos obriga a olhar para outro lado.» Diário de Córdoba «Ninguém deve deixar de ler este livro. É o livro do ano, num ano de grandes livros. O amor como cura. A pobreza como doença. A literatura como poção.» Luisgé Martín «Basta ler a primeira página para perceber que aquele grito de socorro vem do mais fundo de nós. O livro reclama-nos, porque, de certo modo, além de seus protagonistas, somos também seus autores. Descreve com palavras novas, ordenadas de forma insólita, aquilo que fomos e aquilo de que pretendíamos salvar-nos. E isto através de uma prosa que vai e vem num movimento hipnótico, que alterna a ferocidade com a piedade, o sim com o não, o agora com o ontem.» Juan José Millás «Um livro belíssimo e arrebatador, composto em partes iguais de culpa, raiva e amor.» Ignacio Martínez de Pisón «É necessária muita precisão para contar estas coisas, é necessário o ácido, a faca afiada, o alfinete que fura o balão da vaidade. O que fica no final é a limpa emoção da verdade e o desconsolo de tudo o que se perdeu.» Antonio Muñoz Molina «Livro potente, sincero, por vezes descarnado, sobre a perda dos pais, sobre a dor das palavras não ditas e sobre a necessidade de amar e ser amado. Além de tudo isto, muito bem escrito.» Fernando Aramburu «Um livro belo, tão selvagem como delicado, que faz doer e oferece alívio ao mesmo tempo.» Isaac Rosa",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Manuel Vilas\Em tudo havia beleza (3055)\cover.jpg,9789896657574,2019-03-01T12:41:21+00:00,Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Portugal,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Literary, Biographical, General",Em tudo havia beleza,3055

Juan Marsé,"Em meados dos anos quarenta, Ringo é um rapazinho de quinze anos que passa as horas mortas no bar da senhora Paquita, movendo os dedos sobre a mesa, como se praticasse as lições de piano que a família já não pode pagar-lhe. Nessa taberna do bairro de barcelonês de Gracia, o miúdo é testemunha da história de amor de Vicky Mir e do senhor Alonso: ela, uma mulher entrada em anos e abundante de carnes, massagista de profissão, ingénua e apaixonadiça; ele, um cinquentão garboso que acabou por se instalar em sua casa. Ali vivem, junto de Violeta, a filha da senhora Mir, até que sucede algo inesperado: um domingo à tarde, Vicki deita-se nas linhas mortas de um elétrico tentando um suicídio impossível e patético, e o senhor Alonso desaparece para não voltar. A única coisa que dele resta é uma carta que prometeu escrever e que Vicky ficará esperando e desejando até à loucura, enquanto Violeta rebola as suas esplêndidas ancas pelo bairro, rude e indiferente às lisonjas. A vida inteira decorre pelo bar da senhora Paquita e sob o olhar de Ringo, que escuta, lê e finalmente começará a escrever, enchendo de luz a triste caligrafia de toda uma geração que alimentou os seus sonhos nos cinemas de bairro e nas ruas cinzentas de uma cidade onde o futuro parecia algo improvável.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Juan Marse\Caligrafia dos Sonhos (3057)\cover.jpg,9789722061667,2016-11-22T12:22:37+00:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"Fiction, General, Romance",Caligrafia dos Sonhos,3057
Roberto Bolaño,"Escrito nos anos 1980 e descoberto mais de três décadas depois, o romance inédito de Roberto Bolaño, autor de 2666 e Os detetives selvagens. Ambientado na Cidade do México nos anos 1970, O espírito da ficção científica conta a história de Remo Morán e Jan Schrella, dois jovens escritores obcecados por poesia e ficção científica. Enquanto o primeiro tenta incansavelmente encontrar seu espaço na literatura, o segundo passa os dias enviando cartas delirantes a seus autores favoritos de ficção científica. Escrito nos anos 1980 e descoberto agora, esse romance traz todos os elementos que fariam de Bolaño um dos autores mais célebres e importantes da literatura latino-americana. Seus fãs encontrão aqui não apenas a prosa tão facilmente reconhecível — e tão absolutamente inesperada — quanto seus temas mais caros, como a literatura, o amor, a juventude, a amizade, o humor e a rebeldia.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Roberto Bolano\O espirito da ficcao cientifica (3058)\cover.jpg,9788543808314,2017-02-10T11:10:20+00:00,Companhia das Letras,,,1.0,"Fiction, Literary",O espírito da ficção científica,3058

Jeffrey Eugenides,"Um clássico moderno, uma lírica e intemporal história de sexo e suicídio.Adaptado ao cinema por Sofia Coppola, com Kirsten Dunst num dos principais papéis, esta é a história assombrosa e terna das breves vidas das cinco irmãs Lisbon – belas, excêntricas e obsessivamente vigiadas por todo o bairro –, que se suicidam uma a uma no espaço de um ano.Este suicídio marca para sempre os jovens rapazes da vizinhança, que viveram e sofreram com elas... à distância. Vinte anos mais tarde, tentam reconstituir os acontecimentos, reféns ainda da fascinação e da obsessão provocadas pelas misteriosas irmãs: Therese, a intelectual; Mary, a coquete; Bonnie, a asceta; Lux, a libertina; e a pálida e mística Cecilia.Justapondo o comum e o gótico, o humor negro e a tragédia, Jeffrey Eugenides cria um vívido e comovente retrato das emoções da juventude e da perda da inocência. Aclamado de imediato pela crítica e pelo público, As Virgens Suicidas é uma terna e perversa história de amor e terror, sexo e suicídio, memória e imaginação.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Jeffrey Eugenides\As Virgens Suicidas (3060)\cover.jpg,9789722063197,2017-07-03T14:51:26+01:00,Leya,4,,1.0,"Fiction, Romance, Contemporary, General",As Virgens Suicidas,3060

Julia Navarro,"Num hotel da Côte d’Azur, no princípio do século, num grupo de ricos viajantes, o caso de uma respeitável mulher que abandonou o marido, domina a discussão.
Uma distinta senhora de meia-idade, inglesa, acaba por fazer uma confissão sobre as 24 horas mais importantes da sua vida: após a morte do marido, fizera uma viagem pela Europa para escapar à solidão e um dia, décadas atrás, conheceu e apaixonou-se por um jovem que havia perdido tudo no jogo e que pensava em suicídio. Este encontro acaba por mudar a sua vida para sempre.
A linguagem das mãos, neste caso de um jogador, é descrita magistralmente.
Sigmund Freud tinha predilecção por este romance, um dos mais difundidos de Stefan Zweig, onde este demonstra sua habilidade para mergulhar na existência alheia e aborda temas que lhe eram caros e que permanecem actuais, como compulsão, obsessão, paixão e… solidão.

Pepetela,"The white community in Benguela in 1890 was an explosive mixture of ex-convicts, political exiles, republicans, anarchists and colonial officials. Most were united only in their fear of uprisings and a desire to get rich quick. Through the saga of the Semedo family, Yaka gives a panoramic view of events that shaped Angola over the following century. From the nineteenth century penal colony, through slavery, African uprisings and land expropriation, Yaka charts the formation of a nation. The enigmatic Yaka statue owned by the Semedo family provides an unexpected commentary.",C:\Users\Joao\Calibre Library\Pepetela\Yaka (3063)\cover.jpg,9780435909628,1996-02-15T13:54:27+00:00,Pearson Education,4,,1.0,"Fiction, General, Classics",Yaka,3063
